Abstract = {{Riparian communities (those near open water) have often been shown to
   display high structural and compositional diversity and they have been
   identified as potentially serving a keystone role in the landscape.
   Thus, they are the focus of specific management guidelines that attempt
   to protect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We used a digital forest
   inventory database for a portion of the boreal mixed-wood forest in
   Alberta, Canada, to examine whether proximity to a lake affects forest
   composition, age, or configuration. Two analyses were employed: (1)
   forest composition (dominant canopy species, proportional composition of
   different species) and age (decade-of-origin) in bands of 50 m width and
   varying distance from small lakes were compared to forest in a similar
   spatial configuration but away from open water and (2) forest
   composition, dominant canopy species, age, and stand shape metrics were
   examined along transects emanating out from lakes in two regions, which
   varied in topography and dominant forest cover. We found no effect of
   distance from lake on forest age. The proportion of the landscape
   covered by forest of the predominant canopy species increased with
   distance from lake, but this was largely due to a corresponding decline
   in cover of non-forest vegetation rather than a change in forest canopy
   composition. At the spatial resolution of forest management planning,
   riparian forests in this region are of similar age and composition as
   those away from lakes. Since there is no natural analogue for riparian
   buffer strips around lakes, they may not be justified in the context of
   ecosystem management following the natural disturbance paradigm.
   Management of riparian forests should focus on meeting defined
   management and conservation objectives through, for example, protection
   of finer scale features of riparian zones and landscape-level planning
   for allocation of uncut forest. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The maintenance of biodiversity by securing representative and
   well-connected habitat networks in managed landscapes requires a wise
   combination of protection, management, and restoration of habitats at
   several scales. We suggest that the integration of natural and social
   sciences in the form of ``Two-dimensional gap analysis{''} is an
   efficient tool for the implementation of biodiversity policies. The tool
   links biologically relevant ``horizontal{''} ecological issues with
   ``vertical{''} issues related to institutions and other societal issues.
   Using forest biodiversity as an example, we illustrate how one can
   combine ecological and institutional aspects of biodiversity
   conservation, thus facilitating environmentally sustainable regional
   development. In particular, we use regional gap analysis for
   identification of focal forest types, habitat modelling for ascertaining
   the functional connectivity of ``green infrastructures{''}, as tools for
   the horizontal gap analysis. For the vertical dimension we suggest how
   the social sciences can be used for assessing the success in the
   implementation of biodiversity policies in real landscapes by
   identifying institutional obstacles while implementing policies. We
   argue that this interdisciplinary approach could be applied in a whole
   range of other environments including other terrestrial biota and
   aquatic ecosystems where functional habitat connectivity, nonlinear
   response to habitat loss and a multitude of economic and social
   interests co-occur in the same landscape.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1473-1490}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Madagascar has been recently identified as a global hotspot for
   freshwater biodiversity. Loss of most of its eastern rain forest,
   combined with a high incidence of micro-endemism and specialization to
   forest stream habitats, has likely led to extinction of many of the
   island's stream insect species. We compared habitat and
   macroinvertebrate community structure in three streams draining
   protected rain forest within Ranomafana National Park in eastern
   Madagascar and three agriculture streams draining the park's largely
   deforested peripheral zone. Multivariate analyses showed that
   macroinvertebrate communities differed between stream types. Forest
   streams were characterized by species-rich, diverse communities composed
   primarily of collector-gatherers and collector-filterers belonging to
   the orders Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Diptera. In
   contrast, relatively depauperate agriculture stream communities were
   dominated by generalist collector-gatherer taxa mostly belonging to the
   order Ephemeroptera. Agriculture streams had 0-14\% canopy cover,
   significantly higher mean and maximum water temperatures, and
   significantly lower benthic organic matter storage than forest streams
   (71-83\% canopy cover). We found no evidence for higher sedimentation
   rates or nutrient concentrations in agriculture streams. Differences in
   thermal regime may be important in the declines of certain taxa in
   agriculture streams (e.g., Plecoptera). However, our data support the
   hypothesis that differences in stream communities are caused mainly by
   differences among taxa in ability to track shifts in basal resources
   (i.e., terrestrial detritus vs. in situ algal production) caused by
   deforestation. Community simplification and loss of endemic specialist
   taxa will continue if projections of future deforestation are proved
   correct. We recommend that stream biodiversity be considered in future
   conservation planning and propose the creation and maintenance of
   multiuse riparian forests that could serve both ecological and economic
   functions. Given that more than 5 x 10(5) km of stream and river channel
   are affected by tropical deforestation annually, our results have
   potential applications in other tropical regions.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Conservation buffers have the potential to reduce agricultural nonpoint
   source pollution and improve terrestrial wildlife habitat, landscape
   biodiversity, flood control, recreation, and aesthetics. Conservation
   buffers, streamside areas and riparian wetlands are being used or have
   been proposed to control agricultural nonpoint source pollution. This
   paper proposes an innovative strategy for placing conservation buffers
   based on the variable source area (VSA) hydrology. VSAs are small,
   variable but predictable portion of a watershed that regularly
   contributes to runoff generation. The VSA-based strategy involves the
   following three steps: first, identifying VSAs in landscapes based on
   natural characteristics such as hydrology, land use/cover, topography
   and soils; second, targeting areas within VSAs for conservation buffers;
   third, refining the size and location of conservation buffers based on
   other factors such as weather, environmental objectives, available
   funding and other best management practices. Building conservation
   buffers in VSAs allows agricultural runoff to more uniformly enter
   buffers and stay there longer, which increases the buffer's capacity to
   remove sediments and nutrients. A field-scale example is presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the within-VSA
   conservation buffer scenario relative to a typical edge-of-field buffer
   scenario. The results enhance the understanding of hydrological
   processes and interactions between agricultural lands and conservation
   buffers in agricultural landscapes, and provide practical guidance for
   land resource managers and conservationists who use conservation buffers
   to improve water quality and amenity values of agricultural landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The formulation of an effective strategic plan for biodiversity
   conservation in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) requires an assessment
   of the current situation with regard to habitat transformation, and an
   explicit framework for predicting the likelihood of remaining habitat
   (i.e. that potentially available for conservation) being transformed.
   This paper presents the results of a detailed assessment of the current
   and future extent of three important factors that threaten biodiversity
   in the CFR: cultivation for intensive agriculture (including commercial
   forestry plantations), urbanisation, and stands of invasive (self-sown)
   alien trees and shrubs. The extent of habitat transformation was mapped
   at the scale of 1:250,000, using primarily satellite imagery. We
   compared models derived from a rule-based approach relying on expert
   knowledge and a regression-tree technique to identify other areas likely
   to be affected by these factors in future. Cultivation for agriculture
   has transformed 25.9\% of the CFR and dense stands of woody alien plants
   and urban areas each cover 1.6\%. Both models predict that at least 30\%
   of the currently remaining natural vegetation could be transformed
   within 20 years. There was an overall accuracy of 73\% between both
   models although significant differences were found for some habitat
   types. Spatial predictions of future agriculture threats derived from
   the rule-based approach were overestimated relative to the statistical
   approach, whereas future alien spread was underestimated. Threat
   assessment was used to derive conservation targets for subsequent stages
   of conservation planning for the CFR. The importance of integrating
   vulnerability knowledge into conservation planning is discussed. The
   choice of vulnerability analysis (future habitat degradation and/or
   impact on biological entities) and methods will depend on the complexity
   of the threatening processes and the availability of spatial data. (C)

Abstract = {{The formulation of a strategic plan for the conservation of terrestrial
   biodiversity in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR; 87,892 km(2)) requires
   an objective and spatially explicit assessment of the representativeness
   of major habitat categories (surrogates for biodiversity) currently
   under protection. A GIS layer of statutory and non-statutory
   conservation areas was used, along with layers of many biological and
   physical features, to explore the configuration of conserved areas
   relative to key biological and physical indicators. Three analyses were
   performed. (1) Recursive partitioning, a classification-tree analysis
   technique, was used to contrast features of protected areas with
   non-protected areas. (2) The conservation status of 16 primary and 88
   secondary Broad Habitat Units (BHUs; derived on the basis of topography,
   geology, homogeneous climatic zones, and floristic composition) was
   assessed in terms of prescribed conservation targets. (3) The extent to
   which protected areas are able to sustain ecological and evolutionary
   processes was explored by assessing the extent of spatial components of
   these processes for all conservation areas. About 20\% of the CFR is
   protected in some form of conservation area, mostly concentrated on
   sandstone substrates, and areas with high altitude and steep slopes. The
   reservation bias towards upland areas has seriously constrained
   representation of biodiversity pattern and processes. Most of the
   habitat diversity is poorly represented in the current conservation area
   system with only 9\% of the remaining primary BHUs in the lowlands
   conserved. However, almost 50\% of the Mountain Fynbos Complex is
   conserved (largely exceeding its conservation target). Spatial
   components of the ecological processes identified are poorly captured by
   the conservation area network although faunal and floral migration is
   possible in the uplands due to the strong spatial connectivity of the

Abstract = {{The rich biodiversity of the Cape Floristic Region makes a substantial

   national economy. Harvesting of marine resources, such as linefish, rock
   lobster, abalone and bait species, is worth over R 1300 million year 1,
   or R1.12 million km(-l) year(-1). Harvests of fynbos products such as
   wildflowers and thatching reed, and forest products, timber and ferns,
   are worth R27 and R26 ha(-1) year(-1) on average, respectively, and a
   total of R78 million year(-1). Natural resource-based tourism is one of
   the greatest income generators in the region, which is renowned for its
   beauty and floral diversity as well as other nature pursuits such as
   whale watching and angling. The natural resources of the CFR also
   contribute indirectly to the region's economic output: fynbos bees
   contribute to commercial fruit production, and fynbos mountain
   catchments provide the region's main water supply. Less tangible values
   include the option, or future use, value of the region's rich
   biodiversity, and existence value, for which estimates have been made on
   the basis of contingent valuation studies. The total economic value of
   the CFR is estimated to be at least R10,000 million per year (US\$l = R7
   in 2000), equivalent to over 10\% of the regional Gross Geographic
   Product. However, invasion of aliens, transformation of natural
   vegetation and overexploitation of resources threaten the sustainability
   of this value. Invasive alien plants, which are the greatest proximate
   threat to floral diversity, already intercept significant water
   supplies. However, clearing is costly, and while government has an
   incentive to clear publicly owned mountain catchment areas, private
   land-owners do not. Similarly, private benefits of conserving fynbos
   areas do not provide sufficient incentive to protect against
   transformation to more lucrative farming activities, including
   monoculture of indigenous species. Current values of marine resources
   are unlikely to be upheld due to the overexploited status of most
   stocks, a problem which is compounded by poorly defined property rights,
   open access and inadequate law enforcement. It will be necessary to
   provide incentives to private landowners and resource users if optimal
   levels of protection are to be achieved to maximise benefits to society.

Abstract = {{The Mexican state of Tamaulipas located in the northeastern portion of

   organized conservation reserve planning to protect the important
   biological and physical features of Mexico, the Mexican Commission for
   Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO) proposed 13 new terrestrial
   reserves for Tamaulipas. If established these new reserves would
   increase the proportion of terrestrial protected lands in the state to
   over 21\%. We compiled a geographic information system (GIS) using
   existing digital thematic maps of physical and biological features to
   examine how the existing and proposed reserves might serve to protect
   the biodiversity and physical features of the state. We found that most
   of the existing protected sites occur in areas with elevations >
   1000-2000 m with temperate climate and dominated by pine forest, oak
   forest, and cloud forest vegetation cover types. The state's dominant
   biotic region-low elevation coastal plain with tropical and and climate
   types and xeric scrub vegetation-is disproportionately underrepresented
   in the current reserve system. The creation of the proposed areas would
   substantially increase the protection of mid and high elevation lands.

Abstract = {{Indicators of biodiversity have been proposed as a potential tool for
   selecting areas for conservation when information about species
   distributions is scarce. Although tests of the concept have produced
   varied results, sites selected to address indicator groups can include a
   high proportion of other species. We tested the hypothesis that species
   at risk of extinction are not likely to be included in sites selected to
   protect indicator groups. Using a reserve-selection approach, we
   compared the ability of seven indicator groups-freshwater fish, birds,
   mammals, freshwater mussels, reptiles, amphibians, and at-risk species
   of those six taxa-to provide protection for other species in general and
   at-risk species in particular in the Middle Atlantic region of the
   United States. Although sites selected with single taxonomic indicator
   groups provided protection for between 61\% and 82\% of all other
   species, no taxonomic group provided protection for more than 58\% of
   all other at-risk species. The failure to cover at-risk species is
   likely linked to their rarity. By examining the relationship between a
   species' probability of coverage by each indicator group and the extent
   of its geographic range within the study area, we found that species
   with more restricted ranges were less likely to be protected than more
   widespread species. Furthermore, we found that although sites selected
   with indicator groups composed primarily of terrestrial species (birds
   and mammals) included relatively high percentages of those species
   (82-85\%) they included smaller percentages of strictly aquatic species
   (27-55\%). Finally, of both importance and possible utility, we found
   that at-risk species themselves performed well as an indicator group,
   covering an average of 84\% of all other species.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of the importance of land-use history and its legacies in

   makes combating the problem a huge and difficult task. Human impacts on
   our seas take many forms and result not only from activities that affect
   species directly - such as overfishing, in-filling of wetlands and
   coastal deforestation - but also from activities that affect oceans
   indirectly, such as through land-based sources of pollution, freshwater
   diversion from estuaries, invasive species and climate change.
   Due to the expanding scope of both global coastal degradation and
   fisheries conflicts, environmental groups recently have become more and
   more involved in fisheries management and conflict resolution. In
   tackling fisheries issues, most organizations attempt to base their
   projects and advocacy on the best available scientific information.
   These groups sometimes undertake in-house scientific research,
   predictive modelling and meta-analysis. However, in most cases, the
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are recipients of scientific
   information and liaise between the scientific community, decision makers
   and the public. The key scientific information underpinning campaigns
   and field projects addresses three facets of sustainability: (i) the
   levels of resource removal that can be realized without adverse impact
   on the ecosystem, given the particular environmental condition of the
   ecosystem at time of harvest; (ii) the least invasive means by which
   that harvest can be undertaken at desired levels of harvest, such that
   habitat impacts and by-catch are minimized; and (iii) the most
   appropriate stocks for large-scale harvest, namely protecting stocks
   that are sole representatives of genetically unique organisms and stocks
   whose ecological role is critically important and so not redundant.
   Environmental groups, however, are as diverse in their character,
   approach and constituencies as the environmental problems they address.
   They function variously as purveyors of information, as translators of
   scientific and management language to the vernacular, as honest brokers
   (although their own value systems cause some to question their honesty),
   as advocates and lobbyists for certain types of reform or regulatory
   measures, and as adversaries to management agencies and industry when
   invoking environmental litigation. In many of these roles, environmental
   groups have been seen as the antithesis to development, to business
   interests, and to the needs of many user groups. Yet, today,
   environmental groups play an increasingly important non-adversarial role
   in demonstrating how conservation and sustainable use can be
   accomplished, through practical, applied conservation projects that
   benefit users, community groups, business and national interests. If a
   common environmentalist response to fisheries-induced loss of marine
   biodiversity can be said to exist (and this is a dangerous assumption,
   given the diversity of groups and their approaches), it is to synthesize
   existing information, communicate it, and advocate change in policy and
   regulations where felt necessary. In addition, some groups go beyond
   fisheries-by-fisheries management reform to advocate: (i) shifting the
   burden of proof when evaluating fishing impacts on ecosystems; and (ii)
   establishing strictly protected marine reserves to further our
   understanding of and protect species, habitats and ecological processes.
   Such reserves are implemented in a variety of fashions: as components
   within larger, multiple-use protected areas that seek to accommodate a
   wide array of users; as single elements in scientifically designed
   reserve networks; and as one tool of many used in corridor approaches,
   coastal management and regional planning.
   From the environmentalist's or conservationist's perspective, solutions
   lie not in shutting down fisheries but rather in modifying the way we
   undertake management, and in using public awareness to help raise
   political will to conserve marine systems. Coupling current consumer
   awareness and purchasing power with strong and effective management
   could indeed alleviate pressure on many marine species and allow their
   subsequent recovery. Additionally, environmental groups will need to
   recognize and support real willingness among governmental agencies and
   decision makers to protect areas needed for fish spawning, feeding and
   migration through marine reserves, and help such forward-thinking
   agencies to enter into enforceable international agreements to protect
   shared or commons resources. By highlighting such potential successes,
   and by working to demonstrate how success can be achieved, environmental
   groups can begin to shed their image of extremist adversaries, and help
   decision-making bodies implement effective and beneficial management
   regimes.
   A common thread is now emerging from analysis of cases where fisheries
   management and marine conservation has succeeded - and we can well learn
   from this common thread. The central element in these initiatives is a
   holistic approach - one that considers renewable living resources as
   part of a wider, interconnected ecosystem, one that evaluates all
   aspects of production or development and one that treats humans as bone
   fide elements of living systems. These integrated approaches take into
   account ecosystem interconnections and the true ecological costs of
   fisheries, the entire production chain and its environmental costs, and
   human interconnections, and thus the social costs (and benefits) of
   fisheries development. Holistic solutions are those that recognize these
   connections and try to minimize ecological, environmental and social
   costs, while maximizing the benefits (and benefit sharing) that can
   accrue from engagement in well-managed marine resource use. Given the
   magnitude and complexity of global fisheries issues, only such holistic
   prescriptions will make it possible for nations to achieve responsible
   fisheries in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater wetlands support diverse and unique species assemblages, but
   the contribution of the smallest of these habitats to regional
   biodiversity continues to be underestimated, particularly within managed
   forests. We assessed and compared the richness, abundance, and diversity
   of herpetofauna at five small isolated wetlands (0.38-1.06 ha) imbedded
   within a commercial forest landscape in the South Carolina Coastal
   Plain. Continuous drift fences with pitfall traps that completely
   encircled the wetlands were used to sample entering and exiting
   herpetofauna. We also deployed coverboards to sample herpetofauna in the
   adjacent uplands. We captured 9186 individuals of 56 species (20
   amphibians, 36 reptiles) from the five wetlands combined between 1996
   and 1998. Although species richness and community composition were
   similar at the five sites, we found significant differences in
   herpetofaunal abundance and diversity among wetlands. These differences
   did not vary with wetland size but were related to environmental and
   habitat attributes of the surrounding upland stands. Amphibian abundance
   was positively correlated with basal area of upland conifers but
   negatively correlated with presence and size of hardwoods, relationships
   that appeared to be partially influenced by previous stand management.
   Amphibian diversity (H') increased with conifer diameter but decreased
   with increasing distance to nearest wetland. Reptile diversity was
   negatively correlated with upland canopy closure. Our data indicate that
   small isolated wetlands are focal points of herpetofaunal richness and
   abundance in managed coastal plain forests and contribute more to
   regional biodiversity than is implied by their small size or ephemeral
   hydrology. By incorporating small wetland values and functions into
   planning objectives, forest managers can significantly enhance the
   contribution of extensive young-growth forests to regional conservation
   of biodiversity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There are many proposals for managing biodiversity by using surrogates,
   such as umbrella, indicator, focal, and flagship species. We use the
   term biodiversity management unit for any ecosystem-based classificatory
   scheme for managing biodiversity. The sufficiency of biodiversity
   management unit classification schemes depends upon (1) whether
   different biotic elements (e.g., trees, birds, reptiles) distinguish
   between biodiversity management units within a classification (i.e.,
   coherence within classes); and (2) whether different biotic elements
   agree upon similarities and dissimilarities among biodiversity
   management unit classes (i.e., conformance among classes). Recent
   evaluations suggest that biodiversity surrogates based on few or single
   taxa are not useful. Ecological vegetation classes are an
   ecosystem-based classification scheme used as one component for
   biodiversity management in Victoria, Australia. Here we evaluated the
   potential for ecological vegetation classes to be used as biodiversity
   management units in the box-ironbark ecosystem of central Victoria,
   Australia. Eighty sites distributed among 14 ecological vegetation
   classes were surveyed in the same ways for tree species, birds, mammals,
   reptiles, terrestrial invertebrates, and nocturnal flying insects.
   Habitat structure and geographic separations also were measured, which,
   with the biotic elements, are collectively referred to as variables.
   Less than half of the biotic element-ecological vegetation class
   pairings were coherent. Generalized Mantel tests were used to examine
   conformance among variables with respect to ecological vegetation
   classes. While most tests were not significant, birds, mammals, tree
   species, and habitat structure together showed significant agreement on
   the rating of similarities among ecological vegetation classes. In this
   system, use of ecological vegetation classes as biodiversity management
   units may account reasonably well for bird, mammals, and trees; but
   reptiles and invertebrates would not be accommodated. We conclude that
   surrogates will usually have to be augmented or developed as
   `hierarchies to provide general representativeness.}},

Abstract = {{Vast gaps in available information on the spatial distribution of
   biodiversity pose a major challenge for regional conservation planning
   in many parts of the world. This problem is often addressed by basing
   such planning on various biodiversity surrogates. In some situations,
   distributional data for selected taxa may be used as surrogates for
   biodiversity as a whole. However, this approach is less effective in
   data-poor regions, where there may be little choice but to base
   conservation planning on some form of remote environmental mapping,
   derived, for example, from interpretation of satellite imagery or from
   numerical classification of abiotic environmental layers. Although this
   alternative approach confers obvious benefits in terms of
   cost-effectiveness and rapidity of application, problems may arise if
   congruence is poor between mapped land-classes and actual biological
   distributions. I propose three strategies for making more effective use
   of available biological data and knowledge to alleviate such problems by
   (1) more closely integrating biological and environmental data through
   predictive modeling, with increased emphasis on modeling collective
   properties of biodiversity rather than individual entities; (2) making
   more rigorous use of remotely mapped surrogates in conservation planning
   by incorporating knowledge of heterogeneity within land-classes, and of
   varying levels of distinctiveness between classes, into measures of
   conservation priority and achievement; and (3) using relatively
   data-rich regions as test-beds for evaluating the performance of
   surrogates that can be readily applied across data-poor regions.}},

Abstract = {{In Mediterranean countries, inventories of many animal groups
   particularly insects, are incomplete or nonexistent. Hence, a feasible
   spatial picture of unequally surveyed areas is required to ascertain
   which faunistic surveys are good enough to produce reliable estimates of
   species richness. We used generalized linear models to build a
   multiple-regression function through which we predicted the distribution
   of Iberian dung beetle species richness. Given the scarcity and
   unevenness of the species-richness spatial distribution, the number of
   records of a dung beetle database (BANDASCA), falling within each of the
   50 x 50 km grid squares, was chosen as a measure of the sampling effort
   for that square. Examining the asymptotic relationship between the
   number of dung-beetle species and database records for each
   physioclimatic Iberian subregion, we found that 82 grid squares (32\% of
   the total) were adequately sampled. Dung-beetle species richness was
   related in each of these 82 cells to 24 explanatory variables.
   Curvilinear functions, interaction terms, and the significant
   third-degree polynomial terms of latitude and longitude were included to
   model species-richness distribution. The final model accounted for
   62.4\% of the total deviance after we eliminated seven outlier squares,
   with maximum elevation, grassland area, land-use diversity, forest area,
   geological diversity, interaction of terrestrial area and maximum
   elevation, and interaction between calcareous rock, and geological
   diversity and latitude being the most significant independent variables.
   The residuals of the function were not spatially autocorrelated, and we
   validated the final model by a jackknife procedure. Large and
   environmentally complex hotspots in the Iberian Central, Baetic, and
   Subbaetic mountain ranges stand out from the emerging map of species
   richness. Further detailed research is required to determine the
   complementarity of the faunas of these two main hotspots, the key
   question in conservation planning for a dung-feeding beetle.}},

Pages = {{36-55}},
Abstract = {{Clearing of native vegetation is a major threat to biodiversity in
   Australia. In Queensland, clearing has resulted in extensive ecosystem
   transformation, especially in the more fertile parts of the landscape.
   In this paper, we examine Queensland, Australian and some overseas
   evidence of the impact of clearing and related fragmentation effects on
   terrestrial biota. The geographic locus is the semi-arid regions.
   although we recognise that coastal regions have been extensively
   cleared. The evidence reviewed here suggests that the reduction of
   remnant vegetation to 30\% will result in the loss of 25-35\% of
   vertebrate fauna, with the full impact not realised for another 50-100
   years, or even longer. Less mobile, habitat specialists and rare species
   appear to be particularly at risk. We propose three broad principles For
   effective biodiversity conservation in Queensland: (i) regional native
   vegetation retention thresholds of 50910: (ii) regional ecosystem
   thresholds of 30\%: and (iii) landscape design and planning principles
   that protect large remnants, preferably > 2000 ha, as core habitats.
   Under these retention thresholds. no further clearing would be permitted
   in the extensively cleared biogeographic regions such as Brigalow Belt
   and New England Tablelands. Some elements of the biota. however, will
   require more detailed knowledge and targeted retention and management to
   ensure their security. The application of resource sustainability and

   ensure that the biogeographic regions in the north and west of

   illustrate the process of ecoregional planning in marine environments.
   2. The basic steps in ecoregional planning include: identification of
   conservation targets, i.e. species and habitats, collection of data on
   their ecology and distribution; determination of conservation goals for
   the amount of targets that must be protected: and identification of a
   set of sites that meets these goals for all targets.
   3. As a preliminary goal. it was determined that the set of priority
   sites should contain at least 20\%, of the current distribution of each
   target habitat and species.
   4. Two primary tools were used to choose a set of priority sites: a
   reserve selection program. SITES. and interviews and a workshop with
   scientists and managers. The final set of priority sites integrated
   information from these various sources.
   5. The goals were exceeded for all conservation targets in the priority
   sites. On average, 75 and 58\% of the distributions of the habitat

   These landscape variables may be useful in identifying areas that are

Abstract = {{Arthropods constitute well over one-half of the species of higher life
   on the planet and are the dominant terrestrial life form on the planet.
   Unfortunately, very little is known about most arthropod species. There
   are an estimated 163,487 species of insects in North America, of which
   only 66\% are taxonomically known. Similarly, there are an estimated
   35,514 species of North American arachnids, of which only 9316 are
   described; over 73\% have yet to be discovered and described. Without
   the basic taxonomic and life history knowledge for most of the
   terrestrial species (i.e., arthropods) of North American ecosystems,
   land managers are faced with the challenge of developing, selecting, and
   managing biotic reserves and habitat conservation plans for which they
   know very little about the majority of organisms found within such
   reserves or covered by such plans. With respect to arthropods, this
   challenge includes taking into account poorly described species being
   used as political tools to stop development las opposed to actually
   protecting a truly endangered species), thus confounding the habitat
   conservation planning process and ensuring that ``surprises{''} in the

Abstract = {{Mapping species richness and distributions is an important aspect of
   conservation and land use planning, but the time and cost of producing
   maps from field surveys is prohibitive. It is useful, therefore, if
   mappable environmental variables, from a readily accessible source, can
   be used as surrogates for species attributes. We evaluated the power of
   satellite-derived land cover information, from the Land Cover Map of
   Great Britain, to predict species richness and occurrences of
   terrestrial mammals in one hundred 10 x 10 km quadrats, from four
   regions of Britain. The predictive power of the land cover data was
   relatively poor - with a few exceptions, land cover explained less than
   half of the variation in mammal species richness and occurrence in
   regression models. Predictive power was considerably stronger when
   regions were analyzed separately than when analyzed together, and best
   fitting models varied between regions and between mammal taxa.
   Predictive power was also affected (positively or negatively depending
   on taxon) when PCA-ordinated land cover variables were used as
   predictors. The predictive strength of the land cover data was probably
   limited mostly by the high proportion of British mammal species with
   geographic distributions changing rapidly and independently of land
   cover (and hence the non-saturation of preferred habitats), and to a
   lesser extent by shortcomings in the mammal and land cover data, and the
   influence of landscape factors other than land cover on mammal
   distributions. The results suggest that regional stratification is
   essential when attempting to predict species richness and distributions,
   even across relatively limited areas such as Great Britain. We conclude
   that caution is necessary in using results from environmental
   information systems such as this as a basis for conservation and land
   use planning decisions.}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Hong Kong has enjoyed more than 20 years of almost uninterrupted
   economic growth and the territory is widely recognized as one of the
   most successful of the newly industrializing economies. Economic success
   has, however, brought with it a variety of environmental problems
   including deterioration of air and water bodies and the loss of
   terrestrial and marine habitats. Environmental degradation also poses a
   serious threat to local biodiversity. Despite its stated commitment to
   environmental protection, the Kong Kong Government is still strongly
   growth-oriented and the territory's environmental institutions and
   policies often seem ineffective in resolving the conflicts that arise
   between development and the environment.
   To illustrate some of the contradictions inherent in Hong Kong's current
   approach to environmental and conservation issues, this paper focuses on
   the controversy surrounding the fate of the local population of the
   Indo-Pacific humped-back dolphin, or, as it is locally known, the
   Chinese white dolphin (Sousa chinensis). The dolphin's habitat has been
   disrupted by major development projects, marine pollution and fishing
   and shipping activity. It is possible that the species will be extinct
   in Kong Kong waters by the beginning of the next century. The paper
   examines the background to the controversy that has arisen surrounding
   the future of the dolphins and evaluates the Government's attempts to
   develop a conservation strategy to protect them. The preferred
   option-the creation of a dolphin sanctuary within a designated marine
   park area-has been strongly criticized by some local marine biologists
   and conservationists as being inadequate and inappropriate. The failure
   to address effectively the problems faced by the Chinese white dolphin
   may be attributed to the lack of an overall conservation strategy in
   Hong Kong, shortcomings in the territory's environmental impact
   assessment system and limited local scientific knowledge concerning the
   dolphin population. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.}},

Abstract = {{The Nature Conservancy in Illinois has chosen the Illinois
   River-Floodplain Ecosystem as one of its major conservation initiatives
   within our goal of preserving biodiversity in a manner which is
   economically and ecologically sustainable. The Illinois River,
   designated by the National Research Council as one of the few large
   rivers in the United States with a functioning fioodplain and
   floodpulse, provides an opportunity to evaluate how we can restore and
   maintain this river-floodplain system through the cooperation of a
   diverse group of individuals, agencies, and private interests. It is
   also an opportunity to provide a model for large river ecosystem
   management within the larger scope of the Upper Mississippi River
   Watershed. Because most of the watershed is within the state of
   Illinois, it is thought that efforts for planning and implementation can
   be streamlined within state and federal agency guidelines and mandates.
   Through a conservation planning process, the Conservancy has begun to
   identify areas within the river-floodplain system which have high
   quality aquatic and terrestrial communities that are maintained through
   functioning ecological processes of inundation and/or fire. Initial
   estimates have shown nearly 50 rare or imperiled (G1-G3) natural
   communities within the bluff to river areas of the main channel and its
   higher quality tributaries. Working with public and private partners in
   both the tributaries and main river-floodplain system, the Conservancy
   is developing a portfolio of sites which will capture the wide array of
   terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity within this unique system.
   Additionally, as a partner on the Illinois River Valley Partnership
   (IRVP), an effort led by Lieutenant Governor Bob Kustra, the Conservancy
   is working with a variety of state, federal and private partners
   representing agriculture, business, navigation, natural resources, and
   the scientific community to build a framework for preserving and
   restoring the Illinois River system. Through the interactions of these
   partners over the past year, the IRVP has begun to identify projects in
   which we can address both the ecological and economic concerns of
   maintaining a sustainable river system. As a model far large-scale
   public/private partnerships in conservation, the Illinois River will
   provide an unique example for researchers, conservation groups,
   landowners, communities, agencies and citizens to follow for future
   watershed management.}},

Abstract = {{Most conceptual discussions of biological diversity consider
   genetic-level, species-level or ecosystem-level approaches to biological
   diversity. However, few integrate all three levels into a comprehensive
   conservation and management approach. In addition, conceptual
   discussions often fail to consider the spatial and temporal variability
   of the system, unique attributes of a water environment and a scale for
   those factors. Unfortunately, considerations of marine biodiversity are
   often limited to descriptive levels of species or habitat richness. For
   the Indian River Lagoon and most coastal estuaries, information at each
   level of the biodiversity concept is lacking. The complex processes that
   influence and sustain biological diversity are poorly understood and the
   functional importance of the upland-wetland-estuary linkage is often
   overlooked. The functional boundaries of the Indian River Lagoon include
   a complex association of terrestrial, wetland, and estuarine systems
   which combine to form a diverse landscape mosaic. Land-based and
   estuarine-based characteristics must be considered as interdependent
   components of this diverse ecosystem. Land-based anthropogenic impacts
   exert significant influences on IRL water quality, estuarine natural
   communities and biological diversity of the Indian River Lagoon. Land
   acquisition is an important non-regulatory tool that can be used to
   protect biological diversity in coastal estuaries. Well planned local
   land acquisition programs can compliment and enhance state and federal
   conservation initiatives. Land acquisition programs that consider
   connectivity and functional integrity among upland, wetland and
   estuarine natural communities provide an immediate opportunity to
   protect, enhance and restore natural estuarine functions by establishing
   or expanding a protected area network. Land acquisition is an
   economically feasible and ecologically sound approach to begin
   biodiversity protection in the Indian River Lagoon. This paper focuses
   on the Environmentally Endangered Lands Program, Brevard County,
   Florida; an innovative local land acquisition program that provides a
   model local program for biological diversity protection in a coastal
   estuary.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental assessments of regional development projects have been
   used in Mexico to determine where conflicts between conservation of
   biodiversity and resource extraction are likely to occur. Species-rich
   areas have been acknowledged as a priority for conservation. However,
   biological information is incomplete and biased toward accessible sites,
   so species-rich areas cannot be depicted directly from current
   biological knowledge.
   An alternative approach to predicting species-rich areas is presented in
   this article. It is based on the gap analysis technique and involves the
   use of ordination analysis and generalized linear models integrated with
   a geographic information system. This approach was used for locating
   species-rich areas in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Oaxaca, where a
   regional forestry development project was proposed. Baseline information
   consisted of gee-referenced collection sites of terrestrial vertebrates.
   Thirty-two species assemblages were identified by the ordination
   analysis, as well as by 25 generalized linear models. Validation of six
   of these models showed no significant differences between observed and
   predicted species frequencies.
   Results demonstrated that species-rich areas could be depicted even
   under the constraints of environmental assessment in Mexico. A large
   number of species could be used in this analysis due to the minimal
   information required for each species record. This predictive approach
   optimized available biological information for the integration of
   conservation into regional development planning.}},

Abstract = {{1. The types of pressures evident in coastal regions are typified by the
   Jervis Bay region in south-eastern Australia which, despite a long
   history of human occupation, remains largely undisturbed. How much
   longer those values and the ecological processes which sustain them will
   remain viable is questionable.
   2. This paper describes the development of a conservation management
   strategy which sought an integrated approach to management of the
   terrestrial and marine resources of the Bay region. A geographical
   information system (GIS) was developed for the region, using the
   raster-based E-RMS GIS software system.
   3. A continuum of conservation management options for the region was
   defined, ranging from no change to the presently limited protected area
   system (which covers only 7.5\% of the region), to almost complete
   reservation. The preferred option, known as the Jervis Bay Conservation
   Zone, was derived using a landscape ecology approach. This involves a
   coordinated approach to conservation management by private and public
   agencies and individuals, with variable levels of control on the use of
   core habitat and adjacent land/sea areas.
   4. Three specific findings of relevance to the management of coastal
   aquatic resources elsewhere were that (1) traditional
   `reservation-based' approaches to conservation management in isolation
   are not likely to be effective in conserving biodiversity over time; (2)
   the planning process should be open for review by non-technical
   audiences to facilitate community understanding and support; and (3) GIS
   can be a very useful tool for data organization and analysis.}},
