Abstract = {{According to projections by the United Nations, 60\% of the world's
   population will reside in urban areas by 2030. Studies of the ecology of
   cities and ecology in cities will therefore assume increasing relevance
   as urban communities seek to protect and/or enhance their ecological
   resources. Presently, the most serious threats to wildlife include the
   degradation and/or loss of habitats, the introduction and spread of
   problem species, water pollution, unsympathetic management, and the
   encroachment of inappropriate development. Climate change could add to
   these problems through competition from exotic species, the spread of
   disease and pests, increased summer drought stress for wetlands and
   woodland, and sea-level rise threatening rare coastal habitats. Earlier
   springs, longer frost-free seasons, and reduced snowfall could further
   affect the dates of egg-laying, as well as the emergence, first
   flowering and health of leafing or flowering plants. Small birds and
   naturalized species could thrive in the warmer winters associated with
   the combined effect of regional climate change and enhanced urban heat
   island. This article reviews the range of climate-related threats to
   biodiversity in the aquatic, intertidal and terrestrial habitats of
   urban areas. London is used as a case study to illustrate potential
   impacts, and to contend that `green spaces' in cities could be used by
   planners to counter climate-related threats to biodiversity, as well as
   to improve flood control and air quality, and reduce urban heat island
   effects.}},

Pages = {{46-54}},
Abstract = {{Coarse and fine scale ecological criteria were derived that represent
   vital features of protected area networks for biodiversity conservation.
   The criteria were used as a blueprint to assess the capacity of
   legislation to create an ecologically functional Algonquin-Adirondack
   protected area network in Ontario and New York State. International
   treaties, national laws, and provincial and state laws and their
   regulations, were analyzed to determine if they contained provisions for
   incorporating the ecological criteria into conservation networks.
   In Canada, the Canada National Parks Act and the Species at Risk Act
   could be used to create protected areas networks, if their regulations
   were amended appropriately. The Ontario Planning Act was the only
   provincial act with limited capacity to implement some of the ecological
   criteria. Neither American federal law nor New York State law showed any
   capacity to enable protected area network development. However, if the
   Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act were to be enacted, provision
   for creating large-scale ecological networks would exist. New
   legislation should reflect, explicitly, the ecological criteria that
   ensure that networks fulfill their roles over the long term. Any new
   legislation should be harmonized across the different jurisdictions
   involved, as in recent western European cases, to promote network
   creation at large geographic scales. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{1 Many authors have suggested that topography and soils are the major
   determinants of species distributions and community patterns at small or
   regional scales, but few studies addressed the patterns at mesoscales.
   We used Reserva Ducke (100 km(2)) as a model to analyse the effects of
   soil, topography and watersheds on the variation of the herb community
   composition, and to determine the relative importance of the
   environmental factors on species composition.
   2 Taxonomic groups are frequently used as surrogates in studies of
   biodiversity distribution and complementarity, but their efficacy is
   controversial. We therefore studied the correlations between the
   distributional patterns of three different herb groups (Marantaceae,
   pteridophytes and `others') and their responses to environmental
   predictors.
   3 Terrestrial herbs were sampled in 59 plots of 250 x 2 m,
   systematically distributed over the reserve. Plots followed isoclines of
   altitude, to minimize the internal variation of soil. Composition of the
   total herb community and of the three herb groups was summarized with
   PCoA.
   4 Soil structure, represented by PCA axes, was the main determinant of
   the variation in herb composition for all groups, but slope affected
   only pteridophytes. Soil and topography explained less than one-third of
   the variance in community data. Herb composition was significantly
   different between watersheds, but watersheds differ only slightly in
   soil parameters. Our results indicate high turnover in species
   composition, on spatial scales of 5-10 km in central Amazonia, which is
   not necessarily associated with soil change.
   5 Compositional patterns of the three groups analysed were significantly
   correlated, but with low values for the correlation coefficient.
   Although composition was correlated, the responses to environmental
   predictors differed among groups, and the use of one group as a
   surrogate will miss around 50\% of the variation in other groups.
   6 Although important, soil and topography alone cannot predict herb
   community structure. Knowledge of geographical, historical or other
   landscape features, such as watershed morphology, may therefore be
   necessary to predict the turnover patterns over mesoscales. Moreover,
   the same factors may not have the same effectiveness as predictors of
   the structure of seemingly similar biological groups.}},

Abstract = {{1. The marbled newt, Triturus marmoratus, is a vulnerable urodele
   species (listed on Annex IV of the European Habitats Directive).
   However, biological information about their migration and the
   terrestrial habitats they use is relatively scarce. In order to
   investigate the influence of the surrounding habitats of a local pond on
   the directions of pre- and post-breeding migrations, adult newts were
   monitored over two Successive years (from February 2000 to June 2001) at
   a permanent pond in south-western France using a drift fence and pitfall
   traps.
   2. In both sexes the entry and exit directions were non-randomly
   distributed. Furthermore, males and females generally followed similar
   directions facing an oak forest and avoiding barren areas. However, the
   directions followed by postbreeding migrants leaving the pond differed
   from those they followed when coming to the pond.
   3. The distribution of captures around the pond was related to
   environmental factors, and more precisely to vegetation within the
   immediate surroundings of the pond.
   4. The environmental conditions occurring at the end of the spring
   postbreeding migration differed greatly from those occurring during the
   winter prebreeding migration. Thus, vegetation does not exert similar
   attraction during the two migration periods.
   5. This raises the importance of microhabitat diversity in the vicinity
   of the breeding pond, which provides a wide range of suitable shelters
   in different migration periods. Conservation planning must take into
   account the ecological requirements of this endangered species in
   managing buffer zones around the breeding sites. Copyright (c) 2005 John

Abstract = {{1. Growing concern associated with threats to the marine environment has
   resulted in an increased demand for marine reserves that conserve
   representative and adequate examples of biodiversity. Often, the
   decisions about where to locate reserves must be made in the absence of
   detailed information on the patterns of distribution of the biota.
   Alternative approaches are required that include defining habitats using
   surrogates for biodiversity. Surrogate measures of biodiversity enable
   decisions about where to locate marine reserves to be made more reliably
   in the absence of detailed data on the distribution of species.
   2. Intertidal habitat types derived using physical properties of the
   shoreline were used as a surrogate for intertidal biodiversity to assist
   with the identification of sites for inclusion in a candidate system of
   intertidal marine reserves for 17 463 km of the mainland coast of
   Queensland, Australia. This represents the first systematic approach, on
   essentially one-dimensional data, using fine-scale (tens to hundreds of
   metres) intertidal habitats to identify a system of marine reserves for
   such a large length of coast. A range of solutions would provide for the
   protection of a representative example of intertidal habitats in
   Queensland.
   3. The design and planning of marine and terrestrial protected areas
   systems should not be undertaken independently of each other because it
   is likely to lead to inadequate representation of intertidal habitats in
   either system. The development of reserve systems specially designed to
   protect intertidal habitats should be integrated into the design of
   terrestrial and marine protected area systems. Copyright (c) 2005 John

Abstract = {{Habitat degradation through over-grazing and wood collection is
   especially prevalent in developing countries such as South Africa. As
   human populations expand and the demand for land increases, the
   traditional idiom of setting aside protected areas for conservation is
   insufficient and assessment and protection of diversity outside these
   areas is needed. We assessed the impact of land use on lizard
   assemblages in communal rangelands in South Africa by comparing
   abundance, species richness and species diversity between degraded
   communal lands with a protected area. We first quantified vegetation
   differences between the study areas and found marked differences.
   Communal lands had significantly fewer large trees and less ground
   cover. Contrary to prediction, we found no evidence that any species of
   lizard was negatively affected by habitat disturbance. Some species were
   more common in communal lands, and species richness and diversity were
   also higher using certain sampling techniques. Terrestrial diversity was
   likely enhanced due to the preference of many terrestrial lizards for
   open, sparsely grassed areas. We discuss other reasons for increased
   diversity such as the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and/or reduced
   numbers of predators and competitors. We also conducted surveys of
   households and traditional healers to investigate the relationship
   between human uses of reptiles and abundance. The predominant users of
   reptiles were traditional healers. The most commonly used species were
   not encountered in our field surveys, and respondents indicated that
   they appeared to be declining. Our results emphasise the importance of
   integrating local knowledge into biodiversity assessment and
   conservation planning. Although we did not identify a negative impact of
   disturbance on lizard communities, community structure was different and
   this likely influenced ecosystem integrity and function in some way. (C)

Abstract = {{Riparian zones are habitats of critical conservation concern worldwide,
   as they are known to filter agricultural contaminants, buffer landscapes
   against erosion, and provide habitat for high numbers of species. Here
   we test the generality of the notion that riparian habitats harbor more
   species than adjacent upland habitats. Using previously published data
   collected from seven continents and including taxa ranging from
   Antarctic soil invertebrates to tropical rain forest lianas and
   primates, we show that riparian habitats do not harbor higher numbers of
   species, but rather support significantly different species pools
   altogether. In this way, riparian habitats increase regional (gamma-)
   richness across the globe by >50\%, on average. Thus conservation
   planners can easily increase the number of species protected in a
   regional portfolio by simply including a river within terrestrial
   biodiversity reserves. Our analysis also suggests numerous possible
   improvements for future studies of species richness gradients across
   riparian and upland habitats. First, <15\% of the studies in our
   analysis included estimates of more than one taxonomic group of

   variable methodologies and sampling areas in pursuit of richness and

Abstract = {{Aim One of the limitations to using species' distribution atlases in
   conservation planning is their coarse resolution relative to the needs
   of local planners. In this study, a simple approach to downscale
   original species atlas distributions to a finer resolution is outlined.
   If such a procedure yielded accurate downscaled predictions, then it
   could be an aid to using available distribution atlases in real-world
   local conservation decisions.
   Location Europe.
   Methods An iterative procedure based on generalized additive modelling
   is used to downscale original European 50 x 50 km distributions of 2189
   plant and terrestrial vertebrate species to c. 10 x 10 km grid
   resolution. Models are trained on 70\% of the original data and
   evaluated on the remaining 30\%, using the receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) procedure. Fitted models are then interpolated to a
   finer resolution. A British dataset comprising distributions of 81
   passerine-bird species in a 10 x 10 km grid is used as a test bed to
   assess the accuracy of the downscaled predictions. European-wide,
   downscaled predictions are further evaluated in terms of their ability
   to reproduce: (1) spatial patterns of coincidence in species richness
   scores among different groups; and (2) spatial patterns of coincidence
   in richness, rarity and complementarity hotspots.
   Results There was a generally good agreement between downscaled and
   observed fine-resolution distributions for passerine species in Britain
   (median Jaccard similarity = 70\%; lower quartile = 36\%; upper quartile
   = 88\%). In contrast, the correlation between downscaled and observed
   passerine species richness was relatively low (rho = 0.31) indicating a
   pattern of error propagation through the process of overlaying
   downscaled distributions for many species. It was also found that
   measures of model accuracy in fitting original data (ROC) were a poor
   predictor of models' ability to interpolate distributions at fine
   resolutions (rho = -0.10). Although European hotspots were not fully
   coincident between observed and modelled coarse-resolution data, or
   between modelled coarse resolution and modelled downscaled data, there
   was evidence that downscaled distributions were able to maintain
   original cross-taxon coincidence of species-richness scores, at least
   for terrestrial vertebrate groups. Downscaled distributions were also
   able to uncover important environmental gradients otherwise blurred by
   coarse-resolution data.
   Main conclusions Despite uncertainties, downscaling procedures may prove
   useful to identify reserves that are more meaningfully related to local
   patterns of environmental variation. Potential errors arising from the
   presence of false positives may be reduced if downscaled-distribution
   records projected to occur outside the range of original
   coarse-resolution data are excluded. However, the usefulness of this
   procedure may be limited to data-rich regions. If downscaling procedures
   are applied to data-poor regions, then there is a need to undertake
   further research to understand the structure of error in models. In
   particular, it would be important to investigate which species are
   poorly modelled, where and why. Without such an assessment it is
   difficult to support unsupervised use of downscaled data in most
   real-world situations.}},

Abstract = {{Many protected area (PA) systems have developed in response to
   socio-economic and aesthetic criteria and need to be modified to
   increase their conservation value. National gap analyses are an
   important step in describing and addressing this problem, so we sought
   to determine the representativeness of English PAs devoted to
   biodiversity conservation by using Natural Areas (NAs), elevation and PA
   boundary data. We found that National Nature Reserves (NNRs) and Sites
   of Special Scientific Interests (SSSIs) cover only 6.3\% of England and
   are generally small, with respective median areas of 1.1 and 0.2 km(2).
   The English PA system under-represents lowland areas and provides a
   median level of 2.5\% protection for the NA types, with seventy nine per
   cent of NA types having less than 10\% protection. Therefore, we suggest
   that England's PA system needs to be expanded, although this would
   probably entail modification of existing legislation to increase
   involvement by landowners. We also compare our results with previous
   appraisals that used species distribution record data and suggest that
   landscape-level analyses may give a more accurate and less positive
   assessment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The management of wild large herbivores to meet economic, conservation
   and environmental objectives}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1021-1031}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Wild large herbivores provide goods and income to rural communities,
   have major impacts on land use and habitats of conservation importance
   and, in some cases, face local or global extinction. As a result,
   substantial effort is applied to their management across the globe. To
   be effective, however, management has to be science-based. We reviewed
   recent fundamental and applied studies of large herbivores with
   particular emphasis on the relationship between the spatial and temporal
   scales of ecosystem response, management decision and implementation.
   2. Long-term population dynamics research has revealed fundamental
   differences in how sex/age classes are affected by changes in density
   and weather. Consequently, management must be tailored to the age and
   sex structure of the population, rather than to simple population
   counts.
   3. Herbivory by large ungulates shapes the structure, diversity and
   functioning of most terrestrial ecosystems. Recent research has shown
   that fundamental herbivore/vegetation interactions driving landscape
   change are localized, often at scales of a few metres. For example,
   sheep and deer will selectively browse heather Calluna vulgaris at the
   edge of preferred grass patches in heather moorland. As heather is
   vulnerable to heavy defoliation, in the long term this can lead to loss
   of heather cover despite the average utilization rate of heather in a
   management area being low. Therefore, while herbivore population
   management requires a large-scale approach, management of herbivore
   impacts on vegetation may require a much more flexible and site-specific
   approach.
   4. Localized impacts on vegetation have cascading effects on
   biodiversity, because changes in vegetation structure and composition,
   induced by large herbivores affect habitat suitability for many other
   species. As such, grazing should be considered as a tool for broader
   biodiversity management requiring a more sophisticated approach than
   just, for example, eliminating grazing from conservation areas through
   the use of exclosures.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The management of wild large herbivores
   must consider different spatial scales, from small patches of vegetation
   to boundaries of an animal population. It also requires long-term
   planning based on a deep understanding of how population processes, such
   a birth rate, death rate and age structure, are affected by changes in
   land use and climate and how these affect localized herbivore impacts.
   Because wild herbivores do not observe administrative or political
   boundaries, adjusting their management to socio-political realities can
   present a challenge. Many developing countries have established
   co-operative management groups that allow all interested parties to be
   involved in the development of management plans; developed countries
   have a lot to learn from the developing world's example.}},

Abstract = {{The European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis (L., 1758), is threatened
   throughout its distribution, prompting management of habitats and
   populations for conservation. Quantitative data on habitat requirements
   for this species are needed to better evaluate which areas are the most
   suitable, or what actions can improve habitat suitability. We studied
   relationships between the distribution and abundance of E. orbicularis
   and the environment by analysing water quality and features of 39
   wetland and upland habitats in the Po River delta of northern Italy;
   visual transects and point counts were used to determine turtle presence
   and relative abundance. Emys orbicularis occurs more frequently and
   abundantly in permanent wetlands surrounded by woodlands, and its
   presence does not appear to be related to water eutrophication.
   Woodlands strongly influence adjacent wetland features and may be
   important for turtles' terrestrial activities such as nesting and
   dispersal. Habitat management and conservation plans for E. orbicularis
   should include protection of extensive terrestrial woodland habitat
   containing diverse wetland systems, to support turtle survival at
   different life-history stages. The requirements for wetlands and natural
   terrestrial habitat are difficult to meet in the currently
   human-dominated European lowlands; nevertheless, conservation plans for
   this species should take a broad-scale approach.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction of artificial light into wildlife habitat represents a

   kinds of lights on the foraging behavior of Santa Rosa beach mice (
   Peromyscus polionotus leucocephalus). We compared patch use and
   giving-up densities of mice for experimental food patches established
   along a gradient of artificial light in the field. Mice exploited fewer
   food patches near both types of artificial light than in areas with

   Our results show that artificial light affects the behavior of

Abstract = {{Biogeographic information has great potential to enhance systematic
   conservation planning, although it has yet to be routinely incorporated
   in marine situations. Fundamental differences between marine and
   terrestrial environments (physical, biological, and sociopolitical) mean
   that biogeographic data are harder to obtain for marine systems,
   biogeographic boundaries more difficult to define, and the outcomes of
   similar conservation approaches may differ Despite these challenges, an
   understanding of spatial context, connections, and scales of processes
   is needed to set conservation priorities that ensure the representation
   and continued persistence of species and habitats within functioning
   ecosystems. As we discovered in our review, scientific knowledge of
   marine systems is increasing rapidly thanks to recent advances in
   genetics, remote sensing, and geographical information systems. Such
   knowledge and tools have important implications for marine planning. We
   also reviewed the degree to which biogeography is incorporated into
   current marine conservation projects at spatial scales ranging from
   global to local. Overall, initiatives are becoming more regional in
   scope and incorporating biogeographic data in an increasingly rigorous
   manner However, initiatives that use few or no data are also on the rise
   and need to be treated with due caution. We recommend undertaking global
   and regional reviews within biogeographic frameworks; combining
   analytical approaches to determine biogeographic classifications and to
   define a range of potential conservation areas with stakeholder
   involvement to set priorities; understanding contemporary processes that
   maintain species distributions; and acquiring knowledge of historical
   distributions to provide appropriate baselines for current conservation.
   The urgent need for marine conservation, however, means that planning
   should proceed with the best currently available biogeographic
   information even while biogeographic research continues.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Aim A positive relationship between assemblage diversity (AD) -
   equivalent to the biotic version of the environment diversity, ED,
   method - and species diversity has been reported. This being true,
   reserve networks with many different assemblages would be expected to
   represent more species than reserve networks including fewer and less
   different assemblages. This idea was tested using European species atlas
   distributions of terrestrial vertebrates and plants. It is asked
   whether: (1) maximizing AD within one group would represent species
   diversity of this group better than expected by chance; and (2)
   maximizing AD within one group would represent species diversity of
   other groups better than expected by chance.
   Location Europe.
   Methods Three ordination techniques (non-metric multidimensional
   scaling, detrended correspondence analysis and correspondence analysis)
   are used to summarize patterns of compositional turnover within
   assemblages. p-Median location-allocation models are then calculated
   from ordination space to measure the degree of expected species
   representation within the group being sampled as well as the expected
   representation within other groups. Results are compared with
   near-optimal solutions obtained with complementarity-based algorithms
   and to a null model obtained by simulating selection of areas at random.
   Matrix correlation analysis was also performed to investigate broad
   patterns of covariation in compositional turnover of assemblages of
   species belonging to different taxonomic groups and these values were
   compared with correlation in species richness scores between groups.
   Results The AD model did not always represent more species of the group
   being sampled than expected by chance (P < 0.05). Results were
   independent of the method and taxonomic group considered. Effectiveness
   of AD within one group to represent species of other groups varied, but
   in most cases it was worse than using complementarity-based algorithms
   as a surrogate strategy. Even when correlations indicated high
   coincidence between assemblages, taxonomic-based surrogates did not
   always recover more species than expected by chance (P < 0.05).
   Main conclusions Results are discussed in the light of two possible
   explanations: (1) the AD model is based on unrealistic assumptions,
   namely that species have equal probability of having the centre of their
   distributions anywhere in ordination space and that species display
   unimodal, symmetrical, bell-shaped response curves to gradients; (2)
   particular implementation of methods may be inadequate to summarize
   useful complementarity among assemblages, especially for
   restricted-range species. We conclude that both arguments are likely to
   play a role in explaining results, but that opportunities exist to
   improve performance of existing surrogate strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetics sometimes plays a major role in conservation planning,
   although there are still discussions about what to conserve, the
   evolutionary novelty revealed by adaptive process or the evolutionary
   potential expressed by neutral genetic divergence. I discuss the
   relationship between general models of phenotypic evolution and
   branch-length transformations used in phylogenetic diversity (PD)
   indices. Phylogenetic diversity based on molecular phylogenies will be
   satisfactory under a neutral model of evolution with constant divergence
   rates. If evolution of phenotypes occurs under stabilizing or
   directional selection, however, PD will overestimate and underestimate
   evolutionary diversity, respectively. I took into account phenotypic
   patterns in quantitative traits by finding ancestral states and, for
   each ancestral-descendent pathway, transforming branch length into
   amounts of phenotypic evolution before calculating PD. As an example, I
   applied the method in an evaluation of PD in the eight New World
   biodiversity hotspots. I based the evaluation on the phylogeny of
   terrestrial Carnivora and transformed and untransformed (time) branch
   lengths. In all hotspots, time-only PD values were larger than their
   respective phenotypic PD estimates, as expected if stabilizing selection
   drives most of body size evolution. Both PD estimates were highly
   correlated with species richness across the hotspots, but the priority
   ranks changed when loss of species restricted to one hotspot was
   considered. If phenotypic evolution usually occurs under stabilizing
   selection processes, conservation efforts and resources would be reduced
   and/or restricted to a few distinct species with high evolutionary
   rates, reflecting new adaptive peaks. This may be a liberal conservation
   strategy, however, compared with PD values calculated from
   time-calibrate supertrees or molecular phylogenies, and it is still
   necessary to understand how adaptive processes drive the evolution of
   complex phenotypes.}},

   events. Contrasts among 29 terrestrial mammals from five continents
   representing 103 populations indicate that remnant long-distant migrants
   have poor long-term prospects. Nonetheless, in areas of low human
   density in the Western Hemisphere, five social and nongregarious
   species, all from the same region of the Rocky Mountains (U.S.A.), still
   experience the most accentuated of remaining New World LDMs south of
   central Canada. These movements occur in or adjacent to the Greater
   Yellowstone region, where about 75\% of the migration routes for elk
   (Cervus elaphus), bison (Bison bison), and North America's sole
   surviving endemic ungulate, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), have
   already been lost. However, pronghorn still migrate up to 550 km
   (round-trip) annually. These extreme movements (1) necessitate use of
   historic, exceptionally narrow corridors (0.1-0.8 km wide) that have
   existed for at least 5800 years, (2) exceed travel distances of
   elephants (Loxodonta africana) and zebras (Equus burchelli), and (3) are
   on par with those of Asian chiru (Pantholops hodgsoni) and African
   wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). Although conservation planners face
   uncertainty in situating reserves in the most biologically valued
   locations, the concordance between archaeological and current biological
   data on migration through specific corridors in these unprotected areas
   adjacent to the Yellowstone system highlights their retention value. It
   is highly likely that accelerated leasing of public lands for energy
   development in such regions will truncate such migrations. One
   landscape-level solution to conserving LDMs is the creation of a network
   of national migration corridors, an action in the Yellowstone region
   that would result in de facto protection for a multispecies complex.
   Tactics applied in this part of the world may not work in others,
   however, therefore reinforcing the value of site-specific field
   information on the past and current biological needs of migratory
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian communities (those near open water) have often been shown to
   display high structural and compositional diversity and they have been
   identified as potentially serving a keystone role in the landscape.
   Thus, they are the focus of specific management guidelines that attempt
   to protect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We used a digital forest
   inventory database for a portion of the boreal mixed-wood forest in
   Alberta, Canada, to examine whether proximity to a lake affects forest
   composition, age, or configuration. Two analyses were employed: (1)
   forest composition (dominant canopy species, proportional composition of
   different species) and age (decade-of-origin) in bands of 50 m width and
   varying distance from small lakes were compared to forest in a similar
   spatial configuration but away from open water and (2) forest
   composition, dominant canopy species, age, and stand shape metrics were
   examined along transects emanating out from lakes in two regions, which
   varied in topography and dominant forest cover. We found no effect of
   distance from lake on forest age. The proportion of the landscape
   covered by forest of the predominant canopy species increased with
   distance from lake, but this was largely due to a corresponding decline
   in cover of non-forest vegetation rather than a change in forest canopy
   composition. At the spatial resolution of forest management planning,
   riparian forests in this region are of similar age and composition as
   those away from lakes. Since there is no natural analogue for riparian
   buffer strips around lakes, they may not be justified in the context of
   ecosystem management following the natural disturbance paradigm.
   Management of riparian forests should focus on meeting defined
   management and conservation objectives through, for example, protection
   of finer scale features of riparian zones and landscape-level planning

Abstract = {{Madagascar has been recently identified as a global hotspot for
   freshwater biodiversity. Loss of most of its eastern rain forest,
   combined with a high incidence of micro-endemism and specialization to
   forest stream habitats, has likely led to extinction of many of the
   island's stream insect species. We compared habitat and
   macroinvertebrate community structure in three streams draining
   protected rain forest within Ranomafana National Park in eastern
   Madagascar and three agriculture streams draining the park's largely
   deforested peripheral zone. Multivariate analyses showed that
   macroinvertebrate communities differed between stream types. Forest
   streams were characterized by species-rich, diverse communities composed
   primarily of collector-gatherers and collector-filterers belonging to
   the orders Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Diptera. In
   contrast, relatively depauperate agriculture stream communities were
   dominated by generalist collector-gatherer taxa mostly belonging to the
   order Ephemeroptera. Agriculture streams had 0-14\% canopy cover,
   significantly higher mean and maximum water temperatures, and
   significantly lower benthic organic matter storage than forest streams
   (71-83\% canopy cover). We found no evidence for higher sedimentation
   rates or nutrient concentrations in agriculture streams. Differences in
   thermal regime may be important in the declines of certain taxa in
   agriculture streams (e.g., Plecoptera). However, our data support the
   hypothesis that differences in stream communities are caused mainly by
   differences among taxa in ability to track shifts in basal resources
   (i.e., terrestrial detritus vs. in situ algal production) caused by
   deforestation. Community simplification and loss of endemic specialist
   taxa will continue if projections of future deforestation are proved
   correct. We recommend that stream biodiversity be considered in future
   conservation planning and propose the creation and maintenance of
   multiuse riparian forests that could serve both ecological and economic
   functions. Given that more than 5 x 10(5) km of stream and river channel
   are affected by tropical deforestation annually, our results have
   potential applications in other tropical regions.}},

Title = {{The deep-sea floor ecosystem: current status and prospects of
   anthropogenic change by the year 2025}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{219-241}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to review current impacts of human activities
   on the deep-sea floor ecosystem, and to predict anthropogenic changes to
   this ecosystem by the year 2025. The deep-sea floor ecosystem is one of
   the largest on the planet, covering roughly 60\% of the Earth's solid
   surface. Despite this vast size, our knowledge of the deep sea is poor
   relative to other marine ecosystems, and future human threats are
   difficult to predict. Low productivity, low physical energy, low
   biological rates, and the vastness of the soft-sediment deep sea create
   an unusual suite of conservation challenges relative to shallow water.
   The numerous, but widely spaced, island habitats of the deep ocean (for
   example seamounts, hydrothermal vents and submarine canyons) differ from
   typical deep-sea soft sediments in substrate type (hard) and levels of
   productivity (often high); these habitats will respond differently to
   anthropogenic impacts and climate change. The principal human threats to
   the deep sea are the disposal of wastes (structures, radioactive wastes,
   munitions and carbon dioxide), deep-sea fishing, oil and gas extraction,
   marine mineral extraction, and climate change. Current international
   regulations prohibit deep-sea dumping of structures, radioactive waste
   and munitions. Future disposal activities that could be significant by
   2025 include deep-sea carbon-dioxide sequestration, sewage-sludge
   emplacement and dredge-spoil disposal. As fish stocks dwindle in the
   upper ocean, deep-sea fisheries are increasingly targeted. Most (perhaps
   all) of these deep-sea fisheries are not sustainable in the long term
   given current management practices; deep-sea fish are long-lived, slow
   growing and very slow to recruit in the face of sustained fishing
   pressure. Oil and gas exploitation has begun, and will continue, in deep
   water, creating significant localized impacts resulting mainly from
   accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings. Marine mineral extraction,
   in particular manganese nodule mining, represents one of the most
   significant conservation challenges in the deep sea. The vast spatial
   scales planned for nodule mining dwarf other potential direct human
   impacts. Nodule-mining disturbance will likely affect tens to hundreds
   of thousands of square kilometres with ecosystem recovery requiring many
   decades to millions of years (for nodule regrowth). Limited knowledge of
   the taxonomy, species structure, biogeography and basic natural history
   of deep-sea animals prevents accurate assessment of the risk of species
   extinctions from large-scale mining. While there are close linkages
   between benthic, pelagic and climatic processes, it is difficult to
   predict the impact of climate change on deep-sea benthic ecosystems; it
   is certain, however, that changes in primary production in surface
   waters will alter the standing stocks in the food-limited, deep-sea
   benthic. Long time-series studies from the abyssal North Pacific and
   North Atlantic suggest that even seemingly stable deep-sea ecosystems
   may exhibit change in key ecological parameters on decadal time scales.
   The causes of these decadal changes remain enigmatic. Compared to the
   rest of the planet, the bulk of the deep sea will probably remain
   relatively unimpacted by human activities and climate change in the year
   2025. However, increased pressure on terrestrial resources will
   certainly lead to an expansion of direct human activities in the deep
   sea, and to direct and indirect environmental impacts. Because so little
   is known about this remote environment, the deep-sea ecosystem may well
   be substantially modified before its natural state is fully understo}},

Abstract = {{More than 60 Species Action Plans have been published by the Species
   Survival Commission (SSC) of IUCN-The World Conservation Union. They are
   designed to assess the status of threatened species and their habitats,
   and provide prioritised recommendations for action, but there is debate
   about the effectiveness of such plans in stimulating conservation action
   and research. We evaluated three Action Plans covering a group of large
   terrestrial birds, published in 1995. Of 54 projects suggested in these
   plans, 33 had been initiated in the 5 years since publication, and 35
   specific conservation actions were undertaken. Forty-five peer-reviewed
   papers were published, and at least 88 other outputs in the form of
   symposium presentations, posters and popular articles were produced.
   Although it is impossible to demonstrate the effectiveness of species
   action planning through rigorous scientific assessment, these results
   indicate a substantial amount of conservation-relevant activity directly
   attributable to the process. They also highlight the need for a clear
   definition of the role of Action Plans. We suggest that many of the
   criticisms directed toward species action plans result from an
   over-optimistic view of their power to catalyse action, and conclude by

Abstract = {{The formulation of an effective strategic plan for biodiversity
   conservation in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) requires an assessment
   of the current situation with regard to habitat transformation, and an
   explicit framework for predicting the likelihood of remaining habitat
   (i.e. that potentially available for conservation) being transformed.
   This paper presents the results of a detailed assessment of the current
   and future extent of three important factors that threaten biodiversity
   in the CFR: cultivation for intensive agriculture (including commercial
   forestry plantations), urbanisation, and stands of invasive (self-sown)
   alien trees and shrubs. The extent of habitat transformation was mapped
   at the scale of 1:250,000, using primarily satellite imagery. We
   compared models derived from a rule-based approach relying on expert
   knowledge and a regression-tree technique to identify other areas likely
   to be affected by these factors in future. Cultivation for agriculture
   has transformed 25.9\% of the CFR and dense stands of woody alien plants
   and urban areas each cover 1.6\%. Both models predict that at least 30\%
   of the currently remaining natural vegetation could be transformed
   within 20 years. There was an overall accuracy of 73\% between both
   models although significant differences were found for some habitat
   types. Spatial predictions of future agriculture threats derived from
   the rule-based approach were overestimated relative to the statistical
   approach, whereas future alien spread was underestimated. Threat
   assessment was used to derive conservation targets for subsequent stages
   of conservation planning for the CFR. The importance of integrating
   vulnerability knowledge into conservation planning is discussed. The
   choice of vulnerability analysis (future habitat degradation and/or
   impact on biological entities) and methods will depend on the complexity
   of the threatening processes and the availability of spatial data. (C)

   an objective and spatially explicit assessment of the representativeness
   of major habitat categories (surrogates for biodiversity) currently
   under protection. A GIS layer of statutory and non-statutory
   conservation areas was used, along with layers of many biological and
   physical features, to explore the configuration of conserved areas
   relative to key biological and physical indicators. Three analyses were
   performed. (1) Recursive partitioning, a classification-tree analysis
   technique, was used to contrast features of protected areas with
   non-protected areas. (2) The conservation status of 16 primary and 88
   secondary Broad Habitat Units (BHUs; derived on the basis of topography,
   geology, homogeneous climatic zones, and floristic composition) was
   assessed in terms of prescribed conservation targets. (3) The extent to
   which protected areas are able to sustain ecological and evolutionary
   processes was explored by assessing the extent of spatial components of
   these processes for all conservation areas. About 20\% of the CFR is
   protected in some form of conservation area, mostly concentrated on
   sandstone substrates, and areas with high altitude and steep slopes. The
   reservation bias towards upland areas has seriously constrained
   representation of biodiversity pattern and processes. Most of the
   habitat diversity is poorly represented in the current conservation area
   system with only 9\% of the remaining primary BHUs in the lowlands
   conserved. However, almost 50\% of the Mountain Fynbos Complex is
   conserved (largely exceeding its conservation target). Spatial
   components of the ecological processes identified are poorly captured by

Abstract = {{The rich biodiversity of the Cape Floristic Region makes a substantial

   national economy. Harvesting of marine resources, such as linefish, rock
   lobster, abalone and bait species, is worth over R 1300 million year 1,
   or R1.12 million km(-l) year(-1). Harvests of fynbos products such as
   wildflowers and thatching reed, and forest products, timber and ferns,
   are worth R27 and R26 ha(-1) year(-1) on average, respectively, and a
   total of R78 million year(-1). Natural resource-based tourism is one of
   the greatest income generators in the region, which is renowned for its
   beauty and floral diversity as well as other nature pursuits such as
   whale watching and angling. The natural resources of the CFR also
   contribute indirectly to the region's economic output: fynbos bees
   contribute to commercial fruit production, and fynbos mountain
   catchments provide the region's main water supply. Less tangible values
   include the option, or future use, value of the region's rich
   biodiversity, and existence value, for which estimates have been made on
   the basis of contingent valuation studies. The total economic value of
   the CFR is estimated to be at least R10,000 million per year (US\$l = R7
   in 2000), equivalent to over 10\% of the regional Gross Geographic
   Product. However, invasion of aliens, transformation of natural
   vegetation and overexploitation of resources threaten the sustainability
   of this value. Invasive alien plants, which are the greatest proximate
   threat to floral diversity, already intercept significant water
   supplies. However, clearing is costly, and while government has an
   incentive to clear publicly owned mountain catchment areas, private
   land-owners do not. Similarly, private benefits of conserving fynbos
   areas do not provide sufficient incentive to protect against
   transformation to more lucrative farming activities, including
   monoculture of indigenous species. Current values of marine resources
   are unlikely to be upheld due to the overexploited status of most
   stocks, a problem which is compounded by poorly defined property rights,
   open access and inadequate law enforcement. It will be necessary to
   provide incentives to private landowners and resource users if optimal
   levels of protection are to be achieved to maximise benefits to society.

Abstract = {{Indicators of biodiversity have been proposed as a potential tool for

   varied results, sites selected to address indicator groups can include a
   high proportion of other species. We tested the hypothesis that species
   at risk of extinction are not likely to be included in sites selected to
   protect indicator groups. Using a reserve-selection approach, we
   compared the ability of seven indicator groups-freshwater fish, birds,
   mammals, freshwater mussels, reptiles, amphibians, and at-risk species
   of those six taxa-to provide protection for other species in general and
   at-risk species in particular in the Middle Atlantic region of the
   United States. Although sites selected with single taxonomic indicator
   groups provided protection for between 61\% and 82\% of all other
   species, no taxonomic group provided protection for more than 58\% of
   all other at-risk species. The failure to cover at-risk species is
   likely linked to their rarity. By examining the relationship between a
   species' probability of coverage by each indicator group and the extent
   of its geographic range within the study area, we found that species
   with more restricted ranges were less likely to be protected than more
   widespread species. Furthermore, we found that although sites selected
   with indicator groups composed primarily of terrestrial species (birds
   and mammals) included relatively high percentages of those species
   (82-85\%) they included smaller percentages of strictly aquatic species

Abstract = {{Biological control (biocontrol) has successfully regulated pest
   populations in terrestrial agroecosystems, but it has also caused
   negative unintended consequences for native species. Marine biologists
   and resource managers have recently published a growing number of
   proposals to include biocontrol in integrated pest management programs
   in oceans, seas and estuaries. Here, I review six ecologically and
   taxonomically diverse case studies of marine biocontrol programs at
   various stages of planning and implementation. Proposals include viral
   or microbial control of harmful algal blooms, predatory control of the
   ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi in the Black Sea, parasitic regulation of
   the European green crab Carcinus maenas, castration by ciliates of the
   seastar Asterias amurensis in Australia, herbivory of the toxic green
   alga Caulerpa taxifolia in the Mediterranean by sacoglossan sea slugs,
   and insect biocontrol by the planthopper Prokelesia marginata to
   ameliorate ecological impacts of the saltmarsh cordgrass Spartina
   alterniflora. Where data exist, I evaluate these examples in terms of
   lessons marine invasion biologists can glean from the rich history of
   terrestrial biocontrol, and explicitly contrast agroecosystems with
   invaded marine habitats. Host specificity cannot be guaranteed in the
   marine biocontrol proposals examined. Feasible alternatives to classical
   biocontrol in the marine realm should be emphasized, including more
   investment in invasion prevention tools, early detection and eradication
   while invasions are small, and increased attention to native natural

   it poses many more uncertainties and has a much sparser history than its

Abstract = {{Vernal pools in northeastern North America are typically seasonal
   woodland pools that support breeding populations of amphibians and
   invertebrates dependent upon fishless environments for successful
   reproduction. A survey of 304 vernal pools in southern, central, and
   northern Maine, USA was conducted to assess pool physical
   characteristics, landscape setting, and presence of pool-breeding
   amphibians for the purpose of guiding potential pool conservation
   strategies. In particular, information on reproductive effort by
   pool-breeding amphibians was used to assess the statewide applicability
   of the Maine Natural Resources Protection Act's proposed definition of
   Significant Vernal Pool, a category of Significant Wildlife Habitats
   that allows closer environmental review of proposed impacts to vernal
   pools. The results of our study show regional differences in pool
   characteristics and amphibian usage. Defining ``significance{''} based
   on number of egg masses and diversity of vernal pool indicator species
   is a useful tool but should be considered in the context of such
   landscape characteristics as availability of suitable terrestrial
   habitat and distribution of other breeding habitats and wetlands.}},

Abstract = {{The new millennium marks a time when scientific opinion and
   environmentalist sentiment are at last converging on the perception that
   the world's natural marine heritage is facing grave threats. What
   environmentalists have come to call the `marine biodiversity crisis' is
   a pervasive and by now well-documented phenomenon, until recently
   occurring largely unnoticed beneath the deceptively unchanging blanket
   of the ocean's surface. The fact that this problem is essentially an
   invisible one makes it all the more insidious, and our terrestrial bias
   makes combating the problem a huge and difficult task. Human impacts on
   our seas take many forms and result not only from activities that affect
   species directly - such as overfishing, in-filling of wetlands and
   coastal deforestation - but also from activities that affect oceans
   indirectly, such as through land-based sources of pollution, freshwater
   diversion from estuaries, invasive species and climate change.
   Due to the expanding scope of both global coastal degradation and
   fisheries conflicts, environmental groups recently have become more and
   more involved in fisheries management and conflict resolution. In
   tackling fisheries issues, most organizations attempt to base their
   projects and advocacy on the best available scientific information.
   These groups sometimes undertake in-house scientific research,
   predictive modelling and meta-analysis. However, in most cases, the
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are recipients of scientific
   information and liaise between the scientific community, decision makers
   and the public. The key scientific information underpinning campaigns
   and field projects addresses three facets of sustainability: (i) the
   levels of resource removal that can be realized without adverse impact
   on the ecosystem, given the particular environmental condition of the
   ecosystem at time of harvest; (ii) the least invasive means by which
   that harvest can be undertaken at desired levels of harvest, such that
   habitat impacts and by-catch are minimized; and (iii) the most
   appropriate stocks for large-scale harvest, namely protecting stocks
   that are sole representatives of genetically unique organisms and stocks
   whose ecological role is critically important and so not redundant.
   Environmental groups, however, are as diverse in their character,
   approach and constituencies as the environmental problems they address.
   They function variously as purveyors of information, as translators of
   scientific and management language to the vernacular, as honest brokers
   (although their own value systems cause some to question their honesty),
   as advocates and lobbyists for certain types of reform or regulatory
   measures, and as adversaries to management agencies and industry when
   invoking environmental litigation. In many of these roles, environmental
   groups have been seen as the antithesis to development, to business
   interests, and to the needs of many user groups. Yet, today,
   environmental groups play an increasingly important non-adversarial role
   in demonstrating how conservation and sustainable use can be
   accomplished, through practical, applied conservation projects that
   benefit users, community groups, business and national interests. If a
   common environmentalist response to fisheries-induced loss of marine
   biodiversity can be said to exist (and this is a dangerous assumption,
   given the diversity of groups and their approaches), it is to synthesize
   existing information, communicate it, and advocate change in policy and
   regulations where felt necessary. In addition, some groups go beyond
   fisheries-by-fisheries management reform to advocate: (i) shifting the
   burden of proof when evaluating fishing impacts on ecosystems; and (ii)
   establishing strictly protected marine reserves to further our
   understanding of and protect species, habitats and ecological processes.
   Such reserves are implemented in a variety of fashions: as components
   within larger, multiple-use protected areas that seek to accommodate a
   wide array of users; as single elements in scientifically designed
   reserve networks; and as one tool of many used in corridor approaches,
   coastal management and regional planning.
   From the environmentalist's or conservationist's perspective, solutions
   lie not in shutting down fisheries but rather in modifying the way we
   undertake management, and in using public awareness to help raise
   political will to conserve marine systems. Coupling current consumer
   awareness and purchasing power with strong and effective management
   could indeed alleviate pressure on many marine species and allow their
   subsequent recovery. Additionally, environmental groups will need to
   recognize and support real willingness among governmental agencies and
   decision makers to protect areas needed for fish spawning, feeding and
   migration through marine reserves, and help such forward-thinking
   agencies to enter into enforceable international agreements to protect
   shared or commons resources. By highlighting such potential successes,
   and by working to demonstrate how success can be achieved, environmental
   groups can begin to shed their image of extremist adversaries, and help
   decision-making bodies implement effective and beneficial management
   regimes.
   A common thread is now emerging from analysis of cases where fisheries
   management and marine conservation has succeeded - and we can well learn
   from this common thread. The central element in these initiatives is a
   holistic approach - one that considers renewable living resources as
   part of a wider, interconnected ecosystem, one that evaluates all
   aspects of production or development and one that treats humans as bone
   fide elements of living systems. These integrated approaches take into
   account ecosystem interconnections and the true ecological costs of
   fisheries, the entire production chain and its environmental costs, and
   human interconnections, and thus the social costs (and benefits) of
   fisheries development. Holistic solutions are those that recognize these
   connections and try to minimize ecological, environmental and social
   costs, while maximizing the benefits (and benefit sharing) that can
   accrue from engagement in well-managed marine resource use. Given the
   magnitude and complexity of global fisheries issues, only such holistic
   prescriptions will make it possible for nations to achieve responsible
   fisheries in the future.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the continuing appropriation and conversion of natural land
   areas in North America for human uses, there is growing concern about
   the impacts of changing land use on terrestrial bird species. In order
   to promote conservation of critical remaining habitats for birds,
   Partners in Flight (PIF) initiated a project in 1997 in which bird
   conservation plans were prepared by members in each of 60 ecologically
   defined physiographical areas throughout the United States. Accurate,
   nationwide information on the location and extent of vegetative cover
   types, as well as lands under state and federal management, are
   critically important elements in the creation of effective bird
   conservation plans. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF)
   awarded a challenge grant to The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) Wings of the
   Americas Program to assist Partners in Flight in acquiring land cover
   data to serve as the foundation of the planning effort. Canon U.S.A.,
   Inc. and the American Bird Conservancy also contributed support toward
   this goal. The Center for Advanced Spatial Technology at the University
   of Arkansas was contracted to produce the needed land cover maps and
   associated tabular products. Digital land cover databases created by the
   U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Canada Centre for
   Remote Sensing, the University of California-Santa Barbara Department of
   Geography, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of
   Transportation Statistics were used in this project. The final spatial
   products were produced during 1998-1999 and are described in this paper.
   This effort represents the first nationwide habitat mapping project in
   the United States aimed at supporting and enhancing conservation of
   terrestrial bird species.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat managers need information about landscape conditions in relation
   to the composite requirements of species that deserve attention in
   conservation planning. Consequently, we characterized and mapped a
   broad-scale network of habitats for five suites of terrestrial
   vertebrates in the 58 million-ha Interior Columbia Basin (Basin). These
   five suites, referred to as Families, are composed of 44 species whose
   habitats have declined strongly from historical (circa 1850-1890) to
   current periods in the Basin, and thus are of conservation focus. Two of
   the five Families consist of species that depend on old forests, Species
   in another Family depend on early-seral forests, Species in the
   remaining Families depend on sagebrush-steppe or open canopy sagebrush
   and grasslands. For each Family, we characterized current habitat
   conditions at the scale of the watershed (mean size of 22,500 ha), Each
   watershed was classified as one of three conditions. Watersheds in
   Condition I contained habitats whose quality or abundance have changed
   little since the historical period. By contrast, watersheds in Condition
   2 or 3 contained habitats that have changed from historical conditions,
   but in different ways. Watersheds in Condition 2 had habitats of high
   abundance but moderate resiliency and quality, whereas watersheds in
   Condition 3 contained habitats of low abundance or low resiliency and
   quality. The majority of watersheds (59\%-80\%) were in Condition 3 for
   all five Families, whereas the lowest percentage (5\%-25\%) of
   watersheds was in Condition 2 for four of five Families. Connectivity
   among watersheds for all Families appeared low in many parts of the
   Basin due to spatial gaps associated with areas of habitat extirpation.
   Our condition maps constitute a broad-scale network of habitats that
   could be useful for developing multi-species research hypotheses and
   management strategies for the Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater wetlands support diverse and unique species assemblages, but
   the contribution of the smallest of these habitats to regional
   biodiversity continues to be underestimated, particularly within managed
   forests. We assessed and compared the richness, abundance, and diversity
   of herpetofauna at five small isolated wetlands (0.38-1.06 ha) imbedded
   within a commercial forest landscape in the South Carolina Coastal
   Plain. Continuous drift fences with pitfall traps that completely
   encircled the wetlands were used to sample entering and exiting
   herpetofauna. We also deployed coverboards to sample herpetofauna in the
   adjacent uplands. We captured 9186 individuals of 56 species (20
   amphibians, 36 reptiles) from the five wetlands combined between 1996
   and 1998. Although species richness and community composition were
   similar at the five sites, we found significant differences in
   herpetofaunal abundance and diversity among wetlands. These differences
   did not vary with wetland size but were related to environmental and
   habitat attributes of the surrounding upland stands. Amphibian abundance
   was positively correlated with basal area of upland conifers but
   negatively correlated with presence and size of hardwoods, relationships
   that appeared to be partially influenced by previous stand management.
   Amphibian diversity (H') increased with conifer diameter but decreased
   with increasing distance to nearest wetland. Reptile diversity was
   negatively correlated with upland canopy closure. Our data indicate that
   small isolated wetlands are focal points of herpetofaunal richness and
   abundance in managed coastal plain forests and contribute more to
   regional biodiversity than is implied by their small size or ephemeral
   hydrology. By incorporating small wetland values and functions into
   planning objectives, forest managers can significantly enhance the
   contribution of extensive young-growth forests to regional conservation
   of biodiversity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There are many proposals for managing biodiversity by using surrogates,
   such as umbrella, indicator, focal, and flagship species. We use the
   term biodiversity management unit for any ecosystem-based classificatory
   scheme for managing biodiversity. The sufficiency of biodiversity
   management unit classification schemes depends upon (1) whether
   different biotic elements (e.g., trees, birds, reptiles) distinguish
   between biodiversity management units within a classification (i.e.,
   coherence within classes); and (2) whether different biotic elements
   agree upon similarities and dissimilarities among biodiversity
   management unit classes (i.e., conformance among classes). Recent
   evaluations suggest that biodiversity surrogates based on few or single
   taxa are not useful. Ecological vegetation classes are an
   ecosystem-based classification scheme used as one component for
   biodiversity management in Victoria, Australia. Here we evaluated the
   potential for ecological vegetation classes to be used as biodiversity
   management units in the box-ironbark ecosystem of central Victoria,
   Australia. Eighty sites distributed among 14 ecological vegetation
   classes were surveyed in the same ways for tree species, birds, mammals,
   reptiles, terrestrial invertebrates, and nocturnal flying insects.
   Habitat structure and geographic separations also were measured, which,
   with the biotic elements, are collectively referred to as variables.
   Less than half of the biotic element-ecological vegetation class
   pairings were coherent. Generalized Mantel tests were used to examine
   conformance among variables with respect to ecological vegetation
   classes. While most tests were not significant, birds, mammals, tree
   species, and habitat structure together showed significant agreement on
   the rating of similarities among ecological vegetation classes. In this
   system, use of ecological vegetation classes as biodiversity management
   units may account reasonably well for bird, mammals, and trees; but
   reptiles and invertebrates would not be accommodated. We conclude that
   surrogates will usually have to be augmented or developed as
   `hierarchies to provide general representativeness.}},

Abstract = {{Vast gaps in available information on the spatial distribution of
   biodiversity pose a major challenge for regional conservation planning
   in many parts of the world. This problem is often addressed by basing
   such planning on various biodiversity surrogates. In some situations,
   distributional data for selected taxa may be used as surrogates for
   biodiversity as a whole. However, this approach is less effective in
   data-poor regions, where there may be little choice but to base
   conservation planning on some form of remote environmental mapping,
   derived, for example, from interpretation of satellite imagery or from
   numerical classification of abiotic environmental layers. Although this
   alternative approach confers obvious benefits in terms of
   cost-effectiveness and rapidity of application, problems may arise if
   congruence is poor between mapped land-classes and actual biological
   distributions. I propose three strategies for making more effective use
   of available biological data and knowledge to alleviate such problems by
   (1) more closely integrating biological and environmental data through
   predictive modeling, with increased emphasis on modeling collective
   properties of biodiversity rather than individual entities; (2) making
   more rigorous use of remotely mapped surrogates in conservation planning
   by incorporating knowledge of heterogeneity within land-classes, and of
   varying levels of distinctiveness between classes, into measures of
   conservation priority and achievement; and (3) using relatively
   data-rich regions as test-beds for evaluating the performance of
   surrogates that can be readily applied across data-poor regions.}},

Abstract = {{In Mediterranean countries, inventories of many animal groups
   particularly insects, are incomplete or nonexistent. Hence, a feasible
   spatial picture of unequally surveyed areas is required to ascertain
   which faunistic surveys are good enough to produce reliable estimates of
   species richness. We used generalized linear models to build a
   multiple-regression function through which we predicted the distribution
   of Iberian dung beetle species richness. Given the scarcity and
   unevenness of the species-richness spatial distribution, the number of
   records of a dung beetle database (BANDASCA), falling within each of the
   50 x 50 km grid squares, was chosen as a measure of the sampling effort
   for that square. Examining the asymptotic relationship between the
   number of dung-beetle species and database records for each
   physioclimatic Iberian subregion, we found that 82 grid squares (32\% of
   the total) were adequately sampled. Dung-beetle species richness was
   related in each of these 82 cells to 24 explanatory variables.
   Curvilinear functions, interaction terms, and the significant
   third-degree polynomial terms of latitude and longitude were included to
   model species-richness distribution. The final model accounted for
   62.4\% of the total deviance after we eliminated seven outlier squares,
   with maximum elevation, grassland area, land-use diversity, forest area,
   geological diversity, interaction of terrestrial area and maximum
   elevation, and interaction between calcareous rock, and geological
   diversity and latitude being the most significant independent variables.
   The residuals of the function were not spatially autocorrelated, and we
   validated the final model by a jackknife procedure. Large and
   environmentally complex hotspots in the Iberian Central, Baetic, and
   Subbaetic mountain ranges stand out from the emerging map of species
   richness. Further detailed research is required to determine the
   complementarity of the faunas of these two main hotspots, the key
   question in conservation planning for a dung-feeding beetle.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental impact of chemicals generally in the environment is a
   subject that has been approached in recent years in ways that are
   different in concept and practice. They range from chemical
   ``toxicity{''} and ``residual{''} risk assessments based on individuals,
   to broader based, ecological risk assessments. At the same time,
   approaches to considering what in the environment should be protected,
   and how, has also changed. Approaches to this subject vary from strict
   conservation of identified species and areas, to the more general
   concepts of wishing to maintain the biological diversity within and
   amongst all species and habitats, and of protecting large habitat areas
   against irreversible human damage.
   Against this background, approaches to the issue of the possible impact
   of radionuclides in the environment over the last decade or so have
   centred around the various statements made by the ICRP; either
   attempting to support them, or seeking to compensate for their perceived
   deficiencies. There have been arguments that, because man is an integral
   part of ``the environment{''}, and is afforded such a high level of
   protection, then all other components of it would be axiomatically
   protected. There have also been calculations to demonstrate that, in
   hypothetical situations, if radionuclide concentrations in the
   environment were such that the 1mSv a(-1) dose limit to man was not
   exceeded, then the concentrations of radionuclides in the animals and
   plants in their food chain would therefore receive dose-rates less than
   those likely to cause them ``harm{''} at the population level.
   Some countries have been more direct. In the USA, dose ``standards{''}
   for the protection of populations of all aquatic animals have been
   introduced, and consideration is being given to the introduction of dose
   ``standards{''} for populations of all terrestrial plants and animals.
   The introduction of a set of ``no effects{''} dose-rate screening
   reference levels for different types of fauna, to be applied to
   individual sites, is also planned in Canada.
   A somewhat conceptually different approach is that of an attempt to
   develop a hierarchical system for environmental protection based on a
   narrowly defined set of Reference Fauna and Flora analogous to that of
   Reference Man - consisting of defined dose models, data sets to estimate
   exposures, and data on biological effects, to provide a set of ``derived
   consideration levels{''} of dose-effect relationships for individual
   fauna and flora that could be used to help decision making (along with
   other relevant biological information) in different circumstances.
   Research work is also underway to produce systematic frameworks - also
   using a ``reference fauna and flora approach{''} - for assessing
   environmental impact in specific geographic areas, such as European and
   Arctic ecosystems.}},

Pages = {{36-55}},
Abstract = {{Clearing of native vegetation is a major threat to biodiversity in
   Australia. In Queensland, clearing has resulted in extensive ecosystem
   transformation, especially in the more fertile parts of the landscape.
   In this paper, we examine Queensland, Australian and some overseas
   evidence of the impact of clearing and related fragmentation effects on
   terrestrial biota. The geographic locus is the semi-arid regions.
   although we recognise that coastal regions have been extensively
   cleared. The evidence reviewed here suggests that the reduction of
   remnant vegetation to 30\% will result in the loss of 25-35\% of
   vertebrate fauna, with the full impact not realised for another 50-100
   years, or even longer. Less mobile, habitat specialists and rare species
   appear to be particularly at risk. We propose three broad principles For
   effective biodiversity conservation in Queensland: (i) regional native
   vegetation retention thresholds of 50910: (ii) regional ecosystem
   thresholds of 30\%: and (iii) landscape design and planning principles
   that protect large remnants, preferably > 2000 ha, as core habitats.
   Under these retention thresholds. no further clearing would be permitted
   in the extensively cleared biogeographic regions such as Brigalow Belt
   and New England Tablelands. Some elements of the biota. however, will
   require more detailed knowledge and targeted retention and management to
   ensure their security. The application of resource sustainability and
   economic criteria outlined elsewhere in this volume should be applied to
   ensure that the biogeographic regions in the north and west of
   Queensland that are largely intact continue to provide extensive

Abstract = {{1. The overall aim of this work was to identify sites within the
   northern Gulf of Mexico that. if protected. would fully represent the
   biological diversity of the nearshore waters of this ecoregion. In this
   paper. we focus on the eastern subregion, northwest Florida, to
   illustrate the process of ecoregional planning in marine environments.
   2. The basic steps in ecoregional planning include: identification of
   conservation targets, i.e. species and habitats, collection of data on
   their ecology and distribution; determination of conservation goals for
   the amount of targets that must be protected: and identification of a
   set of sites that meets these goals for all targets.
   3. As a preliminary goal. it was determined that the set of priority
   sites should contain at least 20\%, of the current distribution of each
   target habitat and species.
   4. Two primary tools were used to choose a set of priority sites: a
   reserve selection program. SITES. and interviews and a workshop with
   scientists and managers. The final set of priority sites integrated
   information from these various sources.
   5. The goals were exceeded for all conservation targets in the priority
   sites. On average, 75 and 58\% of the distributions of the habitat
   targets were contained Within the priority and high priority sites.
   respectively. These priority and high priority sites only occupied 29
   and 17\% of the study area. respectively.
   6. One of the first steps in the conservation of the bays identified as
   priority sites is the recognition that they are integrally linked by
   important processes to the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic
   environments. Conservation in a part of these estuarine landscapes will
   benefit biodiversity across environments. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley

Abstract = {{An urgent question in biodiversity conservation is the extent to which
   priority areas for one well-known indicator group, like birds,
   ``capture{''} species within other groups. The first tests of this
   question have indicated that capture is high. BirdLife International's
   ``Important Bird Areas{''} (IBAs) work on this assumption. We test this
   for East African IBAs using databases on the distribution of all
   Afrotropical birds, mammals, snakes and amphibians, compiled at the
   Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen and mapped on a
   I-degree grid in the software WORLDMAP, We assess how well the IBAs
   capture terrestrial vertebrate species in the region, and find that
   absolute capture is high. Moreover, capture of regionally endemic and
   threatened species is also very high. We indicate those few important
   species and areas not covered by IBAs. However, the IBAs do not
   generally capture other groups significantly better than do random sets
   of areas covering the same extent. Further, systematically selected
   near-minimum sets of areas can capture more species in considerably less
   area. Nevertheless, these near-minimum sets take into account neither
   ecological processes (in particular, avian migration) nor actual
   land-use patterns. As data become available to incorporate these factors
   and other taxa into quantitative priority-setting techniques, IBAs may
   be able to be planned with added area-efficiency. For now, though,we
   suggest that IBAs are not only very effective on-the-ground priorities
   for the conservation of birds but they also represent the majority of
   other terrestrial vertebrate diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape variables were employed as indices of habitat heterogeneity,
   fragmentation, and human influence on the environment to characterize
   constituent units of a 635 km(2) grid covering the state of
   Pennsylvania. Species richness was determined by overlaying the
   distributions of all 60 terrestrial mammalian species found within the
   state. All landscape variables investigated were correlated with species
   richness. Areas with high topographic variation and low road density had
   the highest species richness. Species sensitive to habitat fragmentation
   were also associated with large forest patches and low road density.
   These landscape variables may be useful in identifying areas that are
   important for the conservation of these species. Associations between
   species distributions and landscape variables were substantiated by
   published habitat associations. Species with extremely limited
   distributions were not associated with landscape variables and represent
   special cases for conservation planners. Rare species, as defined by
   their limited geographical distribution, were not associated with areas
   of high species richness (hotspots). The utility of species richness
   hotspots for conservation planning is disputable. Hotspots of species
   richness were associated with large forest patches and low load density.

Abstract = {{Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Banff National Park, Canada, and the
   surrounding ecosystem exist in one of the most developed and politically
   complex environments where the species persists. Human development and
   activity have significantly stressed the grizzlies' population and
   habitat. The Canadian National Parks Act was amended in 1988 to ensure
   the ecological integrity of nature. When a federal task force (Banff-Bow
   Valley Study) was established in 1994, status of grizzly bears was used
   as a fundamental indicator of terrestrial ecological integrity. Also in
   1994, the Eastern Slopes Grizzly Bear Project (ESGBP) was formed as a
   multi-stakeholder partnership between 4 societal segments: national and
   provincial governments, business, conservation groups, and academic
   researchers. The primary mandate was to scientifically define through
   research the cumulative effects of human development on the regional
   grizzly bear population. An ESGBP Steering Committee meets quarterly to
   set research policy, primarily by using strategic targeting and
   knowledge of the policy and management process to design input into the
   Banff-Bow Valley planning process. Strategic targeting indicated the
   importance of analyzing preliminary data on mortality, habitat
   effectiveness, habitat security, habitat quality, and landscape
   linkages. ESGBP data on these topics significantly influenced policy
   decisions because we: (1) took a multi-takeholder and interagency
   approach to research, (2) established a solid public understanding of
   the issue before discussion of solutions, (3) provided the messages as
   experts outside government, (4) involved key decision makers directly in
   developing the park management plan, and they understood our concerns
   and contributed solutions, (5) provided specific targets and goals that
   could be incorporated into policy, and (6) were persistent and timely in
   presenting our results (goals and targets) and their implications.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To explore biogeographic patterns of terrestrial vertebrates in
   Maine, USA using techniques that would describe local and spatial
   correlations with the environment.
   Location Maine, USA.
   Methods We delineated the ranges within Maine (86,156 km(2)) of 275
   species using literature and expert review. Ranges were combined into
   species richness maps, and compared to geomorphology, climate, and woody
   plant distributions. Methods were adapted that compared richness of all
   vertebrate classes to each environmental correlate, rather than
   assessing a single explanatory theory. We partitioned variation in
   species richness into components using tree and multiple linear
   regression. Methods were used that allowed for useful comparisons
   between tree and linear regression results. For both methods we
   partitioned variation into broad-scale (spatially autocorrelated) and
   fine-scale (spatially uncorrelated) explained and unexplained
   components. By partitioning variance, and using both tree and linear
   regression in analyses, we explored the degree of variation in species
   richness for each vertebrate group that could be explained by the
   relative contribution of each environmental variable.
   Results In tree regression, climate variation explained richness better
   (92\% of mean deviance explained for all species) than woody plant
   Variation (87\%) and geomorphology (86\%). Reptiles were highly
   correlated with environmental variation (93\%), followed by mammals,
   amphibians, and birds (each with 84-82\% deviance explained). In
   multiple linear regression, climate was most closely associated with
   total vertebrate richness (78\%), followed by woody plants (67\%) and
   geomorphology (56\%). Again, reptiles were closely correlated with the
   environment (95\%), followed by mammals (73\%), amphibians (63\%) and
   birds (57\%).
   Main conclusions Comparing variation explained using tree and multiple
   linear regression quantified the importance of nonlinear relationships
   and local interactions between species richness and environmental
   variation, identifying the importance of linear relationships between
   reptiles and the environment, and nonlinear relationships between birds
   and woody plants, for example. Conservation planners should capture
   climatic variation in broad-scale designs; temperatures may shift during
   climate change, but the underlying correlations between the environment
   and species richness will presumably remain.}},

   the basic taxonomic and life history knowledge for most of the

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{423-435}},

Abstract = {{Mapping species richness and distributions is an important aspect of
   conservation and land use planning, but the time and cost of producing
   maps from field surveys is prohibitive. It is useful, therefore, if
   mappable environmental variables, from a readily accessible source, can
   be used as surrogates for species attributes. We evaluated the power of
   satellite-derived land cover information, from the Land Cover Map of
   Great Britain, to predict species richness and occurrences of
   terrestrial mammals in one hundred 10 x 10 km quadrats, from four
   regions of Britain. The predictive power of the land cover data was
   relatively poor - with a few exceptions, land cover explained less than
   half of the variation in mammal species richness and occurrence in
   regression models. Predictive power was considerably stronger when
   regions were analyzed separately than when analyzed together, and best
   fitting models varied between regions and between mammal taxa.
   Predictive power was also affected (positively or negatively depending
   on taxon) when PCA-ordinated land cover variables were used as
   predictors. The predictive strength of the land cover data was probably
   limited mostly by the high proportion of British mammal species with
   geographic distributions changing rapidly and independently of land
   cover (and hence the non-saturation of preferred habitats), and to a
   lesser extent by shortcomings in the mammal and land cover data, and the
   influence of landscape factors other than land cover on mammal
   distributions. The results suggest that regional stratification is
   essential when attempting to predict species richness and distributions,
   even across relatively limited areas such as Great Britain. We conclude
   that caution is necessary in using results from environmental
   information systems such as this as a basis for conservation and land
   use planning decisions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{191-204}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Estimates of density are not always independent of the area over
   which populations are censused, Instead, lower densities tend to be
   recorded for species when they are censused over larger areas. This may
   have serious implications for both intra- and interspecific comparisons
   of density, with relevance to such issues as conservation prioritization
   and management strategies, because differences in density map simply
   result from differences in census areas.
   2. Here, we use long-term population census data for British birds in
   the period 1968-91, drawn from the Common Birds Census (CBC), to examine
   relationships between density and census area within species, and the
   consequences of these relationships for intraspecific and interspecific
   density comparisons.
   3. Most British bird species exhibit statistically significant negative
   relationships between density and census area. We used these
   relationships to standardize mean density estimates for all species to a
   common census area. These area-adjusted estimates were usually very
   similar to geometric mean density estimates calculated without reference
   to census area.
   4. For a subset of species recorded from a large number (> 30) of census
   sites in each year in the period 1968-91, we used intraspecific
   density-area relationships for each year to standardize mean density
   estimates to a common census area in all years. Again, the area-adjusted
   estimates for each year were usually very similar to the simple
   geometric mean density estimates calculated for the species in the same
   year.
   5. These results are encouraging, but are certainly a consequence of the
   relatively limited range of census areas used here, and the fact that
   the mean census area varies little across species, or across pears
   within species, Moreover, those species occupying few sites are the most
   likely to have area-biased densities, but are the species for which
   area-correction will be most difficult.
   6. Overall, the results suggest that past analyses conducted using the
   CBC data are unlikely to have been seriously confounded by variation in
   census area. Nevertheless, they do highlight that the effects of census
   area will require consideration by anyone planning to measure or use
   densities for comparative purposes either within or among species.}},

Abstract = {{Hong Kong has enjoyed more than 20 years of almost uninterrupted
   economic growth and the territory is widely recognized as one of the
   most successful of the newly industrializing economies. Economic success
   has, however, brought with it a variety of environmental problems
   including deterioration of air and water bodies and the loss of
   terrestrial and marine habitats. Environmental degradation also poses a
   serious threat to local biodiversity. Despite its stated commitment to
   environmental protection, the Kong Kong Government is still strongly
   growth-oriented and the territory's environmental institutions and
   policies often seem ineffective in resolving the conflicts that arise
   between development and the environment.
   To illustrate some of the contradictions inherent in Hong Kong's current
   approach to environmental and conservation issues, this paper focuses on
   the controversy surrounding the fate of the local population of the
   Indo-Pacific humped-back dolphin, or, as it is locally known, the
   Chinese white dolphin (Sousa chinensis). The dolphin's habitat has been
   disrupted by major development projects, marine pollution and fishing
   and shipping activity. It is possible that the species will be extinct
   in Kong Kong waters by the beginning of the next century. The paper
   examines the background to the controversy that has arisen surrounding
   the future of the dolphins and evaluates the Government's attempts to
   develop a conservation strategy to protect them. The preferred
   option-the creation of a dolphin sanctuary within a designated marine
   park area-has been strongly criticized by some local marine biologists
   and conservationists as being inadequate and inappropriate. The failure
   to address effectively the problems faced by the Chinese white dolphin
   may be attributed to the lack of an overall conservation strategy in
   Hong Kong, shortcomings in the territory's environmental impact
   assessment system and limited local scientific knowledge concerning the
   dolphin population. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.}},

Abstract = {{1. Faced with the prospect of dealing with several hundred or even
   thousands of habitat sites, environmental managers in dense pond
   landscapes often have insufficient information.
   2. In addition, there is a need to treat Fond habitats as a totality, in
   that the intervening terrestrial matrix is relevant to the distribution
   and persistence of certain species.
   3. Part of the terrestrial matrix is concerned with the spatial
   distribution of ponds and their `connectedness', termed here
   `pondscape'.
   4. An initial approach to delineating `pondscape' is demonstrated. Such
   delineation enables environmental managers not only to conceptualize
   core areas of pond habitat, but also to trace changes in spatial extent

   from proposed development.

Abstract = {{One of the most important provisions of the U.S. Endangered Species Act
   precludes the `'taking'' of listed species on both public and private
   land. In past Endangered Species Act litigation, take has been broadly
   interpreted to include the destruction or modification of habitats ns
   well ns the direct killing of animals. This requirement created an
   extensive burden on private landowners to provide habitats for listed
   species. This burden was substantially lessened when the ESA was
   modified in 1982 to allow incidental takings conditioned on preparation
   of a satisfactory `'habitat conservation plan.'' Because the majority of
   listed species are imperiled due to habitat modification, most habitat
   conservation plans must demonstrate defensible methods to mitigate
   against incidental habitat loss. A review of HCPs for the Northern
   Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis), and other species, indicates that
   mitigation solutions are often arbitrary lacking an empirical foundation
   in the species' life history requirements Based on data from the Spotted
   Owl, we illustrate a biologically based method for estimating the areal
   requirements necessary to mitigate against the take of essential
   habitats Toward this goal we adopt the concept of `'core area,'' that
   portion of an animal's home range that receives disproportionate use. We
   estimated core areas by means of the adaptive kernel density function
   and tested against a null distribution of animal use that assumes a
   bivariate, uniform distribution of locations within the home range. The
   method we illustrate, which is defensible, repeatable, and empirical, is
   a clear improvement over the ad hoc methods used in many habitat
   conservation plans. Further, the methods we propose should be applicable
   to a large number of terrestrial species for which home range is a
   meaningful concept.}},

Abstract = {{The City of Austin, Texas, is one of the fastest growing metropolitan
   areas in the United States. It is also in one of the most biologically
   diverse terrestrial ecosystems in the world: the Ba{[}cones Canyonlands.
   Five cave invertebrates and two species of birds that inhabit the area
   are listed as threatened or endangered, two species of plants are
   candidates for listing, several others are considered rare and of
   concern, and a species of the salamander has also been proposed for
   listing. A habitat conservation plan, of `'national significance...''
   according to Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbit (Haurwitz 1996), has
   been under development for the last several years to conserve those
   endangered species through a 2400-ha system of preserves and to allow
   development to continue in more than 162,000 ha of surrounding area. The
   preserve system, comprising several units ranging in size from less than
   a hundred to several thousand hectares, would be bordered in many
   instances by developed areas. Development and maintenance of the
   infrastructure necessary for new and existing development, both
   commercial and residential, could have negated the biological Value of
   the preserves (e.g., power-line corridors, water-treatment pipelines and
   facilities). The challenge of bringing this plan to fruition illustrates
   the complex biological, technical, and sociological context within which
   habitat conservation planning may occur. Resolving resource use
   conflicts of this nature have several commonalities that over-arch these
   contexts. If recognized and addressed, one may move easily and foster
   positive results. These commonalities can be expressed as principles
   such as: relying on scientists to recognize, but not solve problems;
   acting before a scientific consensus is achieved; including human
   motivation and responses as part of the system to be studied and
   managed; and confronting uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{In the U.S. National Biological Service's gap analysis, potential
   distributions of terrestrial vertebrate species are based on the
   synthesis of wildlife habitat relation data and then modeled using a
   vegetation cover map derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. Using
   long-term species lists from eight National Parks in Utah we evaluated
   the adequacy of the wildlife habitat relations data generated by gap
   analysis in predicting species distributions at landscape scales.
   Omission and commission error rates were estimated for major taxonomic
   groups and for each national park. Depending on the taxonomic group,
   omission error ranged from 0 to 25\%, whereas commission error ranged
   from 4 to 33\%. Error rates were highest in amphibians and reptiles and
   lowest for birds and mammals. In general the error rate declined as the
   size of the park increased. The Utah wildlife habitat relation models
   performed well when used to predict the presence or absence of
   terrestrial vertebrates in eight national parks in Utah and should
   provide valuable information for making conservation decisions. They
   also provide a measure of support for the use of these models within the
   gap analysis framework. Although it is likely that accuracy of wildlife
   habitat relation models will vary from state to state, and even
   considerably within a state, the modeling process seems robust enough to
   provide a reasonably high level of accuracy for use in conservation

Abstract = {{Most conceptual discussions of biological diversity consider
   genetic-level, species-level or ecosystem-level approaches to biological
   diversity. However, few integrate all three levels into a comprehensive
   conservation and management approach. In addition, conceptual
   discussions often fail to consider the spatial and temporal variability
   of the system, unique attributes of a water environment and a scale for
   those factors. Unfortunately, considerations of marine biodiversity are
   often limited to descriptive levels of species or habitat richness. For
   the Indian River Lagoon and most coastal estuaries, information at each
   level of the biodiversity concept is lacking. The complex processes that
   influence and sustain biological diversity are poorly understood and the
   functional importance of the upland-wetland-estuary linkage is often
   overlooked. The functional boundaries of the Indian River Lagoon include
   a complex association of terrestrial, wetland, and estuarine systems
   which combine to form a diverse landscape mosaic. Land-based and
   estuarine-based characteristics must be considered as interdependent
   components of this diverse ecosystem. Land-based anthropogenic impacts
   exert significant influences on IRL water quality, estuarine natural
   communities and biological diversity of the Indian River Lagoon. Land
   acquisition is an important non-regulatory tool that can be used to
   protect biological diversity in coastal estuaries. Well planned local
   land acquisition programs can compliment and enhance state and federal
   conservation initiatives. Land acquisition programs that consider
   connectivity and functional integrity among upland, wetland and
   estuarine natural communities provide an immediate opportunity to
   protect, enhance and restore natural estuarine functions by establishing
   or expanding a protected area network. Land acquisition is an
   economically feasible and ecologically sound approach to begin
   biodiversity protection in the Indian River Lagoon. This paper focuses
   on the Environmentally Endangered Lands Program, Brevard County,
   Florida; an innovative local land acquisition program that provides a
   model local program for biological diversity protection in a coastal
   estuary.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental assessments of regional development projects have been
   used in Mexico to determine where conflicts between conservation of
   biodiversity and resource extraction are likely to occur. Species-rich
   areas have been acknowledged as a priority for conservation. However,
   biological information is incomplete and biased toward accessible sites,
   so species-rich areas cannot be depicted directly from current
   biological knowledge.
   An alternative approach to predicting species-rich areas is presented in
   this article. It is based on the gap analysis technique and involves the
   use of ordination analysis and generalized linear models integrated with
   a geographic information system. This approach was used for locating
   species-rich areas in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Oaxaca, where a
   regional forestry development project was proposed. Baseline information
   consisted of gee-referenced collection sites of terrestrial vertebrates.
   Thirty-two species assemblages were identified by the ordination
   analysis, as well as by 25 generalized linear models. Validation of six
   of these models showed no significant differences between observed and
   predicted species frequencies.
   Results demonstrated that species-rich areas could be depicted even
   under the constraints of environmental assessment in Mexico. A large
   number of species could be used in this analysis due to the minimal
   information required for each species record. This predictive approach
   optimized available biological information for the integration of
   conservation into regional development planning.}},

Abstract = {{Arthropods, the most diverse component of terrestrial ecosystems, occupy
   a tremendous variety of functional niches and microhabitats across a
   wide array of spatial and temporal scales. We propose that conservation
   biologists should take advantage of terrestrial arthropod diversity as a
   rich data source for conservation planning and management. For reserve
   selection and design, documentation of the microgeography of selected
   arthropod taxa can delineate distinct biogeographic zones areas of
   endemism community types, and centers of evolutionary radiation to
   improve the spatial resolution of conservation planning. For management
   of natural areas, monitoring of terrestrial arthropod indicators can
   provide early warnings of ecological changes, and can be used to assay
   the effects of further fragmentation on natural areas that no longer
   support vertebrate indicator species. Many arthropod indicators respond
   to environmental changes more rapidly than do vertebrate indicators,
   which may exhibit population responses that do not become evident until
   too late for proactive management Not all arthropod taxa are equally
   effective as indicators for conservation planning and the qualities of
   indicators can differ for purposes of inventory versus monitoring.
   Assemblages of arthropod taxa used as biogeographic probes in
   inventories should exhibit relatively high species diversity, high
   endemism, and encompass the geographic range of interest. For monitoring

   environmental perturbations and a diversity of life-history and

Abstract = {{Tropical Asian rivers are characterized by their flow seasonality. One
   (sometimes two) peaks in discharge cause temporary declines in
   phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos biomass, but lead to
   inundation of river floodplains and significant land-water interactions.
   Fishes undertake lateral or longitudinal breeding migrations within the
   river system during the flood season, which is marked also by intensive
   feeding upon allochthonous inputs.
   Among the diverse human influences upon tropical Asian rivers, three
   threats stand out. Firstly, degradation of drainage basins (particularly
   through deforestation and overgrazing) leads to increased suspended
   sediment loads and extensive flooding. Excessive floodplain siltation
   alters habitats causing species decline or disappearance. The second
   threat - river regulation and control - has been practised widely in the
   region for centuries but, with the planned development of massive
   projects on the Yangtze and Mekong Rivers, the potential for
   environmental damage has increased. Flow regulation reduces flood-season
   peaks, changing the magnitude and extent of floodplain inundation and
   land-water interactions. Fish breeding migrations may be disrupted,
   because dams block migration routes or changed flow regimes fail to
   stimulate reproduction. River pollution is pervasive throughout the
   region, and constitutes the third threat. Untreated sewage is a
   particular problem in densely-populated areas, and pollution by
   industrial effluents and mining wastes is becoming more important. The
   effects of pollution in tropical Asian rivers are essentially the same
   as those recorded in north-temperate regions. However, biological
   understanding has yet to be matched by an ability to halt or limit river
   degradation.
   Together, the three threats have led to declines and range constrictions
   of aquatic animals and those terrestrial species associated with
   riparian corridors and floodplains. River dolphins and certain
   crocodilians are particularly threatened, but declines in species of
   waterfowl, floodplain deer, a host of fishes, macrophytes, and
   invertebrates have been documented. Reversing the trend is difficult as
   pollution, flow regulation, and drainage-basin degradation have
   non-additive detrimental effects on river ecosystems, and enhance the
   success of exotic invasive species. Moreover, our ability to predict the
   outcome of man-made changes is hampered by a lack of knowledge of
   species' life histories and a paucity of data on the trophic basis of
   production. Despite a lack of detailed information, conservation of
   tropical Asian rivers will be effected only if limnologists move beyond
   the bailiwick of science. Ecologically viable management strategies for
   tropical Asian rivers will succeed only if the socioeconomic context of
   development plans is taken into account. A failure to rise this
   challenge will result in the further degradation of these endangered
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of mammals (94 spp.=38\% of the Australian total),
   land birds (252 spp.=52\%), and terrestrial reptiles (269 spp.=39\%) in
   north-western Australia are analysed. Of these species, 133 (mostly
   reptiles) are restricted to this region. Reptiles (and especially
   endemic species) characteristically have small ranges in this area. For
   all three groups, diversity is highest in coastal, high rainfall areas
   (especially of Arnhem Land and the northern Kimberley). Such areas are
   relatively well represented in the existing nature reserve system.
   Assemblages of species are mapped, on the basis of classification of the
   123 1-degrees latitude by 1-degrees longitude cells in the region. For
   both mammal and bird species, four defined assemblages were distributed
   in high rainfall coastal areas, inland low rainfall areas and two
   transitional zones, all extending over a broad east-west span. Reptile
   assemblages show a similar initial (wet-dry) division, but then split
   into east and west subdivisions. For all three animal groups,
   transitional and inland assemblages are poorly reserved (<0.25\% of land
   area).
   A total of 58 reserves occur in the region. Most are small (median 24
   kM2) and concentrated around population centres. Biological information
   is lacking for most reserves. Largely because of the dispersion of
   existing reserves, almost one quarter of the species considered (and
   about the same proportion of endemic species) are not known to occur in
   any conservation reserve in the region. Priorities are assigned for the
   placement of future reserves. The most significant additions should be
   in the north Kimberley, south-west Kimberley, northern fringe of the
   Tanami Desert, Gulf of Carpentaria hinterland and eastern Arnhem Land.
   The conservation of this fauna is not dependent solely on the provision
   of a park network, but demands also informed management of reserves and
   adequate environmental protection of land outside reserves.}},
