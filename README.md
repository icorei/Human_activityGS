# Hunting in GS

This repository contains data and code for the scientific manuscript _Shifting cultivation and hunting across the savanna-forest mosaic in the Gran Sabana, Venezuela: Facing changes_ (under review)

Abstract Overexploitation of bushmeat in tropical forests has increased in recent years, creating debate about the sustainability of current hunting rates. The Empty Forest hypothesis predicts that current hunting rates in tropical forests can lead to a widespread loss of biodiversity and a reduction in vertebrate abundance. Alternatively, the Garden Hunting hypothesis states that heterogeneous agroforestry landscapes maintain similar species richness as pristine forests, but with species composition dominated by savanna species. Here, we combined cameras trap surveys and spatially explicit dataset on Pemón indigenous hunting in mosaic of savanna and rainforest in the Gran Sabana, Venezuela.

## Repository structure

* *R* folder: Contains code (R scripts) for analysis (model fit)
* *Rdata* folder: Contains R-data files with the raw observations and spatial data
* *pbs* folder: PBS job files for running the R-code on the [Katana HPC](https://unsw-restech.github.io/index.html) @ [UNSW](https://github.com/unsw-edu-au)
* *documentation*: R-markdown files and PDF output describing the model fit and analysis

Code comments are in Spanish and/or English.
